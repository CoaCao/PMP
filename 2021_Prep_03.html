                            Explanation: <br>
                            The scenario describes an organizational change that will likely have a significant impact
                            on the project. You, as the project manager, identify several actions that can be taken to
                            address the situation. Each of the actions will involve a particular project artifact. Note
                            that activity can impact more than one project artifact, but, in this case, there is a
                            particular artifact that will be primarily needed.<br>
                            If an identified risk has an approved risk response, it should be recorded in the risk
                            register. Contingency reserves are a common risk response that can be assigned to address a
                            specific risk. Although in this scenario, it is not known whether or not the reorganization
                            was identified as a risk, the project manager should check the risk register to see if
                            contingency reserves have been allocated for this risk.<br>
                            It is reasonable to assume that the loss of project team members and the onboarding of their
                            replacements will be an impediment to the project. The new team members will likely have a
                            learning curve as they learn about the project. An impediment, also known as an issue,
                            should have a responsible party assigned, and the owner should be recorded in the issue
                            log.<br>
                            The lessons learned register is a project document where any knowledge gained during the
                            course of the project can be recorded. The process of replacing project team members may
                            generate key learnings, which should be documented in the lessons learned register.<br>
                            The stakeholder register should contain identification information, including contact
                            information for all identified stakeholders. New project team members are considered
                            stakeholders, and their information should be documented in the stakeholder register.<br>
                            Since the scenario identifies the project as a hybrid, it is possible that the Kanban method
                            may be incorporated into the project management plan. A Kanban board is an information
                            radiator that can be used to track work as it progresses through the project. The work
                            recorded in the Kanban board could be expressed as task assignments, user stories, or
                            features.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            The question implies that the project manager has been relying too heavily on managing the
                            project rather than leading the project team. Project managers need to employ both
                            leadership and management and strike the right balance between them to be successful.
                            Developing the project team and providing a vision for success represents an emphasis on
                            leadership. All of the incorrect answer choices are examples of greater management rather
                            than leadership. Therefore, of the available options, the project manager could have spent
                            more time developing the project team and providing a vision for project success.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Focused more on the bottom line<br>
                            Incorrect. This answer choice represents a greater focus on management versus leadership.
                            The question suggests that the project manager needs to focus more on leadership and rely
                            less on management.<br>
                            B. Spent more time developing the project team and providing a vision for project
                            success<br>
                            Correct. The question indicates that the project manager has been relying too heavily on
                            managing the project rather than leading the project team. Developing the project team and
                            providing a vision for success represents more of an emphasis on leadership.<br>
                            C. Directed the team using positional power<br>
                            Incorrect. Leadership emphasizes relational power over positional power. Directing using
                            positional power represents management over leadership, and the question implies that the
                            project manager needs to rely less on management and more on leadership.<br>
                            D. Emphasized the administrative aspects of the project<br>
                            Incorrect. The question suggests that the project manager needs to spend less time and
                            effort on managing the project and focus more on leading the project team. Emphasizing the
                            administrative aspects of the project is related to management and not leadership.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            The performance measurement baseline is an integrated scope-schedule-cost plan for the
                            project work against which project execution is compared to measure and manage performance.
                            This baseline is widely used on traditional projects. The scenario, however, is talking
                            about work to be completed incrementally using iterations. This approach is typical of agile
                            methods. Therefore, it can be assumed that the project, as a whole, is managed using the
                            hybrid project management approach. Each iteration is a short, fixed time period to
                            undertake work followed by a demonstration of functionality or design. Based on the
                            demonstration, relevant stakeholders and the team hold a retrospective review.
                            Demonstrations and reviews help check progress against the plan (e.g., performance
                            measurement baseline) and determine if any changes to the project scope, schedule, or
                            execution processes are necessary, which is exactly what the question asks.<br>

                            A. Conduct iteration review and iteration retrospective meetings<br>
                            Correct. Iterations are typically used on agile and/or hybrid projects to incrementally
                            develop deliverables. At the end of an iteration, the team demonstrates the product
                            increment. Another meeting, retrospective, is held to review the process used by the team.
                            Demonstrations help determine if any changes to the project scope or schedule are required;
                            retrospectives identify what works well and what should be improved in the executing
                            processes used by the team.<br>
                            B. Request that the team report project status during daily standups<br>
                            Incorrect. It's a common misconception that daily standup meetings are aimed to provide
                            project status. Project managers that are used to traditional methods tend to turn daily
                            standups into status meetings, thus negating the benefit of what a daily standup is all
                            about: a short, typically 15-min, meeting to report on work done yesterday (including any
                            impediments to progress) and work planned for today.<br>
                            C. Submit a change request at the beginning of each iteration<br>
                            Incorrect. While it is reasonable to assume that changes will be requested on any project,
                            change requests should be submitted as and when needed rather than at the beginning of each
                            iteration. Without knowing specific details in the scenario, submitting a change request at
                            the beginning of each iteration seems too prescriptive and unnecessary.<br>
                            D. Conduct individual and team assessments at the end of each iteration<br>
                            Incorrect. Individual and team assessments are tools that can be used as part of the Develop
                            Team process to identify the areas of the team's strengths and weaknesses. While these tools
                            may help determine areas of improvement in the work process used by the team, it is unlikely
                            that they will be effective in the understanding of changes required to be made to scope or
                            schedule.<br>

                            incorrect.<br>
                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            A project may be terminated for legal cause. In this case, compliance with the cease and
                            desist order requires the termination of the project. Even though the project should be
                            terminated, the project manager lacks the authority to terminate a project. The decision to
                            terminate a project requires approval and authorization by an appropriate authority, such as
                            the project sponsor. Therefore, of the choices provided, seeking approval to terminate the
                            project from the appropriate authority is what the project manager should do first in this
                            situation.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Seek approval to terminate the project<br>
                            Correct. The project should be terminated based on the legal action. The decision to
                            terminate the project does not lay with the project manager, but rather requires approval
                            and authorization by an appropriate authority.<br>
                            B. Resort to alternative dispute resolution<br>
                            Incorrect. Alternative dispute resolution is a mechanism used in claims administration
                            between the buyer and the seller. The question does not describe a dispute between the buyer
                            and the seller, but rather between the performing organization and their competitor.<br>
                            C. Terminate the project for legal cause<br>
                            Incorrect. While this answer choice is technically correct, a project manager does not have
                            the authority to terminate a project. The decision to terminate the project must first be
                            approved and authorized by the appropriate authority. There is another answer choice that
                            addresses the latter point and is, therefore, a better answer to the question asked.<br>
                            D. Update the business case as necessary<br>
                            Incorrect. A project manager may make recommendations but does not have the authority to
                            update the business case as it is not a project document. Additionally, the business case is
                            typically not updated after the project is initiated.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            In the scenario, the project management office (PMO) is driving a transition to agile by
                            using a hybrid project management approach where some agile best practices are incorporated
                            into an existing predictive framework. Since the PMO is driving this change, it is
                            reasonable to assume that they have done some planning on how to bring the project team(s)
                            up to speed with agile best practices. Additionally, one of the typical responsibilities of
                            the PMO is to provide project management training. In this case, the PMO may lack the
                            internal resources to provide such training. Still, they should be able to secure external
                            resources as needed to ensure a successful transition to a hybrid model. At the very least,
                            the PMO should be able to provide some guidance on how to obtain the needed training.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Empower the team to self-organize and study agile best practices<br>
                            Incorrect. While it's true that agile teams are self-organizing and empowered to make
                            decisions related to their work, the scenario describes an organization that has never
                            attempted agile/hybrid projects before and the team that is not equipped to work in a hybrid
                            environment. Therefore, empowering the team would unlikely to bring the desired results.<br>
                            B. Request the training from the project management office (PMO)<br>
                            Correct. The PMO will typically provide project managers with resources to improve
                            productivity. In this case, the PMO may or may not have internal resources with the
                            necessary knowledge to provide agile training. However, the PMO should be able to provide
                            guidance and external resources, if needed, to train the project team on agile best
                            practices.<br>
                            C. Add the risk of the team's inadequate agile skills to the risk register<br>
                            Incorrect. Embarking on a new project management approach does represent a project risk, and
                            this risk should be accounted for in the risk register. However, the question is asking
                            about the best course of action with regard to the missing skills. Merely documenting the
                            risk in the risk register would not resolve the problem.<br>
                            D. Check the lessons learned repository for agile best practices<br>
                            Incorrect. The lessons learned repository should contain knowledge gained from past
                            projects. However, the scenario stipulates that the performing organization has only
                            utilized predictive project management. Therefore, it is unlikely that there will be any
                            relevant information regarding agile best practices in the lessons learned repository.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            The scenario describes a project that is managed using waterfall methods as evident by the
                            approved project management plan and the performance measurement baseline. At the same time,
                            the project team holds daily standup meetings, which are typical for agile projects.
                            However, holding such meetings is not exclusive for agile projects. Any project, whether
                            waterfall or agile, can benefit from the team that meets daily to discuss work done, work
                            planned, and any impediments to progress. The combination of practices from both traditional
                            and agile projects results in a hybrid project management approach. The main goal of
                            including the project stakeholders in the daily standups is to maintain effective
                            relationships with these individuals and groups. Appropriate communication strategies are
                            vital to maintaining such relationships. Having stakeholders attend the daily standup
                            meetings is an example of this communication strategy. While typically daily standups are
                            held by and for the team members, stakeholders can also be invited, where appropriate.
                            Transparency in communications builds trust between the team and stakeholders and promotes
                            healthy and effective relationships with the stakeholders.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Comparing the work completed vs. planned as specified in the baseline<br>
                            Incorrect. Comparing the work completed vs. planned is typically done as part of the
                            variance analysis. Such an analysis is often time-consuming and usually involves the
                            implementation of various tools and techniques. Daily standup meetings described in the
                            scenario are not an appropriate venue for these activities.<br>
                            B. Resolving the issues and impediments encountered by the team<br>
                            Incorrect. While resolving the issues and impediments encountered by the team can be part of
                            a meeting (sometimes called "a parking lot") that is held immediately after the daily
                            standup, the main goal of inviting stakeholders to the daily standup is stakeholder
                            engagement rather than problem-solving.<br>
                            C. Maintaining effective relationships with the key project stakeholders<br>
                            Correct. Stakeholder engagement and project communications are closely related. Effective
                            and open communications between the project team and stakeholders typically nurture
                            effective relationships between all parties involved in the project, thus increasing the
                            chances of a project's success.<br>
                            D. Clarifying roles and responsibilities of the team and the stakeholders<br>
                            Incorrect. The roles and responsibilities of the team and the stakeholders are typically
                            clarified at the beginning of the project, specifically, as part of the project's kick-off
                            meeting agenda. Having stakeholders at the daily standup meetings described in the scenario
                            is done for a different reason.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            The question indicates that the project has a schedule baseline and is using an agile team.
                            These circumstances imply that an agile development cycle is being used within an
                            overarching project management plan, making this project a hybrid. Given the fact that half
                            of the development team has been reassigned, it is reasonable to assume that the existing
                            project backlog will not be completed within the schedule baseline. With the limited
                            information presented in this scenario, it is clear that the project scope and/or the
                            schedule baseline will need to be adjusted, or the project might need to be terminated
                            prematurely. When a project uses baselines to track performance, a modification to a
                            baseline requires an approved change request. Unless stated otherwise in the scenario, the
                            project manager lacks the authority to adjust baselines or terminate a project at will. The
                            best course of action for the project manager in this scenario is to submit a change request
                            to adjust the project scope and/or schedule baseline as necessary. Within the change control
                            process, the changes need to be evaluated against all project constraints, and the
                            authorized stakeholder(s) will need to decide on the best option.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Provide the sponsor with a formal letter that the project is terminated since achieving
                            the project objectives is unrealistic with the remaining resources<br>
                            Incorrect. If the project scope and/or schedule cannot be adjusted, then the project may
                            very well need to be terminated. However, the decision to cancel a project does not reside
                            with the project manager. The project sponsor and any relevant stakeholders will need to
                            evaluate the project based on the remaining resources and decide the fate of the
                            project.<br>
                            B. Request the remaining team members to run three more sprints to determine a new velocity
                            so that a new project completion date can be estimated<br>
                            Incorrect. A typical sprint length is two weeks, so this action would likely take six weeks
                            to complete. Although establishing a new stable velocity might be useful information, the
                            project manager should not delay the decisions that will inevitably need to be made. For
                            example, if it is ultimately decided to terminate the project, then there would be a
                            significant waste of resources resulting from the delay.<br>
                            C. Mandate the use of overtime and allocate bonuses for the remaining team members to bridge
                            the gap and ensure that the project objectives are met<br>
                            Incorrect. Since the size of the project team has been cut in half, the remaining team
                            members would likely need to work twice as much to bridge the gap. Asking the team members
                            to double their productivity for the remainder of the project is unsustainable and goes
                            against acceptable project management practices regardless of the bonuses paid.<br>
                            D. Submit a change request to revise the schedule and/or scope baseline based on the
                            remaining resources and evaluate the options on how to proceed<br>
                            Correct. It is reasonable to assume that with the project team size reduced by half, the
                            existing schedule and/or scope baselines cannot be achieved. The project scope will need to
                            be reduced, and/or the schedule will need to be extended in this scenario. If the baselines
                            cannot be adjusted, then the project sponsor and any authorized stakeholders may need to
                            terminate the project. The first step for the project manager would be to submit a change
                            request so the needed changes can be analyzed against the project constraints.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            The scenario describes a situation in which several project risks have been realized. As a
                            result, other issues (not necessarily risks) may arise. These issues need to be recorded in
                            the issue log to ensure they are investigated and resolved. These new issues are typically
                            identified in risk review meetings in the aftermath of risk response implementation. Risk
                            review meetings are among the tools and techniques that can be used during the Monitor Risks
                            process which is the process that you are carrying out in the scenario described. Therefore,
                            the risk review meeting best describes the activity in which you and your team are
                            involved<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Risk review meeting<br>
                            Correct. Risk reviews are scheduled regularly and should examine and document the
                            effectiveness of risk responses in dealing with overall project risk and with identified
                            project risks. Risk reviews may result in the identification of issues that have arisen as a
                            result of risks that have occurred. These issues would be recorded in the issue log to
                            ensure they are investigated and resolved, and potentially added to the risk register as
                            part of the iterative Identify Risks process.<br>
                            B. Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis<br>
                            Incorrect. The Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process prioritizes individual project
                            risks for further analysis by assessing their probability of occurrence and impact. You
                            would conduct this process after additional risks have been identified. However, examining
                            and documenting the effectiveness of the implemented risk responses in dealing with the
                            realized risks is not part of this process.<br>
                            C. Identify Risks<br>
                            Incorrect. Identify Risks is the process of identifying individual project risks as well as
                            sources of overall project risk and documenting their characteristics. Although this choice
                            may seem like a plausible option, the question is focused on issues, not risks.<br>
                            D. Risk audit<br>
                            Incorrect. Risk audits are a type of audit that may be used to consider the effectiveness of
                            the risk management process. A risk audit ensures that the processes of the Project Risk
                            Management Knowledge Area are being conducted properly and is not concerned with the risks
                            or issues themselves.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            Caves and common is a workspace layout practice recommended by an eXtreme Programming (XP)
                            software development method where the center of the room is used for group work to maximize
                            osmotic communication and information transfer, while the outside of the room is set up with
                            individual areas, "caves", where people can work quietly, make private calls, and take care
                            of their need for separation. In the scenario, it seems as if the project manager took care
                            of the osmotic communication by colocating the team members in the common area; however, did
                            not give sufficient considerations for the caves to provide the needed quiet areas for
                            individual team members to work without being interrupted or distracted by the surrounding
                            noise.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Caves and common<br>
                            Correct. 'Caves and common' refer to two different areas in a workspace. Common is the area
                            where most of the work is done most of the time by most of the team members. Caves are
                            private, quiet spaces where the team members can work on their own when they need to focus
                            and want to avoid being distracted.<br>
                            B. Tacit knowledge<br>
                            Incorrect. Tacit knowledge is not a tool. It is a concept that describes the knowledge
                            residing in the minds of individual team members or teams and is normally shared through
                            conversations and interactions between people.<br>
                            C. Pair programming<br>
                            Incorrect. Pair programming is an agile technique in which two team members develop software
                            code in pairs by periodically switching the roles of the coder and observer. While pair
                            programming may help in focusing on a specific programming task, pair programming does not
                            "protect" the team members from the chit-chat noise.<br>
                            D. Networking<br>
                            Incorrect. Networking is an example of an interpersonal and team skill that involves
                            interactions with others to exchange information and develop contacts. In the scenario, some
                            of the team members seek a quiet place to focus on difficult technical tasks. Networking is
                            unlikely to help in this situation.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            The scenario describes a situation where a development team is having conflict over the
                            sprint goal. All project teams will inevitably experience some level of conflict as the
                            project progresses, and lower levels of conflict are considered healthy for the team. Speed
                            Leas, the author of many books on conflict management, developed a model that categorized
                            five levels of conflict, including a "problem to solve", "disagreement", "contest",
                            "crusade", and finally "world war". In this situation, the team members are working through
                            the differing opinions in a respectful manner without any need for intervention. This
                            situation is best described as a level one conflict, which is a "problem to solve". The
                            incorrect answer choices represent either a stage of team development or a more extreme
                            level of conflict where collaboration has been lost.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. The storming phase<br>
                            Incorrect. The storming phase represents one of the stages of the Tuckman ladder model. The
                            Tuckman ladder model addresses team development rather than levels of conflict.<br>
                            B. A crusade<br>
                            Incorrect. A crusade is the fourth of five levels of conflict. A crusade is characterized by
                            team members splitting into entrenched factions, where people may be attacked for their
                            affiliations rather than their ideas. However, in this scenario, the team is still working
                            as a cohesive unit to reach an agreement.<br>
                            C. The forming stage<br>
                            Incorrect. According to the Tuckman ladder model of team development, the forming stage is
                            the phase where the team members meet and learn about the project. In this scenario, the
                            project team is already working on an existing project. Additionally, The Tuckman ladder
                            model represents the stages of team development rather than levels of conflict.<br>
                            D. A problem to solve<br>
                            Correct. A problem to solve represents a level one conflict out of five. The scenario
                            indicates that the team may be in disagreement with each other, but they are actively
                            listening to each other's concerns and confidently working toward a resolution without the
                            need for intervention.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            The scenario implies that the project is managed using mostly a predictive project
                            management approach with the change control board (CCB), a comprehensive project management
                            plan, a fully elaborated work breakdown structure (WBS), and a detailed project schedule.
                            The existence of the product owner suggests the project has agile elements. The project is
                            characterized by a high rate of changes, and it is reasonable to assume that the vast
                            majority of these changes are necessary, as the product owner keeps approving them. However,
                            the project is behind schedule due to the CCB being unable to process the changes timely. It
                            seems as there is a conflict in the way the changes are handled on the project: the product
                            owner approves the changes, but the changes still go to the CCB for further review. The
                            predictive model is not well-suited to projects with a high rate of changes as the formal
                            change control process seeks to limit all but the most important changes. In this case,
                            incorporating some agile best practices will allow the product to evolve as needed without a
                            burdensome change control process. By having the project team work directly with the product
                            owner, the high rate of change can be managed more efficiently and effectively. Note that
                            bypassing the change control process would require an approved change request to modify the
                            change management plan and likely other elements of the project management plan. Therefore,
                            the project manager should first seek approval to make this change.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Request the termination of the existing project and seek approval to initiate a new
                            project that will utilize agile methodologies<br>
                            Incorrect. Due to the high rate of change, incorporating agile methodologies might prove
                            beneficial for this project. However, terminating the project is an extreme action, which is
                            only warranted when there is a high chance that the project cannot meet its objectives. In
                            the scenario, the project is behind schedule, which is not an uncommon situation.<br>
                            B. Submit a change request to update the project schedule to reflect the delays caused by
                            the CCB's long process times<br>
                            Incorrect. While the project schedule will have to be updated to reflect the delays, the
                            project schedule (unlike the schedule baseline) is a project document. Unless stated
                            otherwise in the scenario, project documents do not require an approved change request to be
                            modified.<br>
                            C. Seek approval to bypass the change control process and have the project team collaborate
                            directly with the product owner<br>
                            Correct. The core problem in this scenario is that the high rate of changes combined with a
                            formal change control process is causing the project to run behind schedule. Incorporating
                            some agile practices within the existing framework will allow the product to evolve
                            unencumbered.<br>
                            D. Instruct the product owner that the project is using a predictive model, which means most
                            of the changes should be rejected<br>
                            Incorrect. The stringent change control process typical of the predictive model does seek to
                            limit changes. The fact that the product owner is approving most of the changes suggests
                            that they are necessary for the project. The project manager should work on a solution to
                            facilitate the high rate of change rather than attempting to stifle needed changes.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            This question is an example of a few one-line knowledge-based questions that you may
                            encounter on your exam. However, no memorization is required to answer this question
                            correctly. The Project Quality Management Knowledge Area includes three processes: Plan
                            Quality Management, Manage Quality, and Control Quality. In the first process, the project
                            management plan is developed, in the second process, the plan is translated into executable
                            activities, and in the last process, those activities are monitored for effectiveness. The
                            answer choice that reads, "Translating the quality management plan into executable quality
                            activities" best addresses the question asked. Manage Quality is the process of translating
                            the quality management plan into executable quality activities that incorporate the
                            organization's quality policies into the project.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Identifying quality requirements and standards for the project and its deliverables<br>
                            Incorrect. This answer choice describes the Plan Quality Management process.<br>
                            B. Leading and performing the work defined in the project management plan<br>
                            Incorrect. This answer choice describes the Direct and Manage Project Work process.<br>
                            C. Monitoring and recording results of executing the quality management activities<br>
                            Incorrect. This answer choice describes the Control Quality process.<br>
                            D. Translating the quality management plan into executable quality activities<br>
                            Correct. This answer choice describes the Manage Quality process and is, therefore, the best
                            answer to the question asked.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            The scenario describes a project manager who develops the project management plan, most
                            likely the stakeholder engagement plan. From the way the question is framed, it seems that
                            past projects were managed using a predictive project management approach, as evident from
                            the change control process that was ineffective in handling changes and allowing scope
                            creep. On predictive projects, stakeholder involvement is usually limited to milestones and
                            gates. This often leads to a disconnection between stakeholders and the team. The project
                            manager understands this and decides to institute regular interactions with the stakeholder
                            community throughout the project, a practice that is typical for agile projects.
                            Incorporating an agile practice into a traditional project makes the project hybrid. Such
                            practice may help in mitigating risk, building trust, and supporting adjustments earlier in
                            the project life cycle, thus reducing costs and increasing the likelihood of project
                            success. However, it is unclear if regular interactions with the stakeholder community
                            throughout the project would reduce (or increase) scope. It is reasonable to assume that
                            these interactions would lead to a better-defined scope since the stakeholders will provide
                            their feedback. The reduced scope is the 'least' likely outcome of the project manager's
                            decision and is, hence, the best answer to the question asked.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Reduced scope<br>
                            Correct. When stakeholders are regularly involved and provide their feedback on the product
                            under development, it is likely that the scope will be better defined. However, this does
                            not necessarily mean that the scope will be reduced. Therefore, of the choices provided, the
                            reduced scope is the 'least' likely outcome of the project manager's decision.<br>
                            B. Mitigated risk<br>
                            Incorrect. Regular interactions with stakeholders would result in more frequent feedback on
                            the product being developed, thus allowing the project team to adjust the product based on
                            stakeholder needs and reduce the risk of building something that does not meet stakeholder
                            expectations.<br>
                            C. Reduced cost<br>
                            Incorrect. When stakeholders are regularly involved and provide their feedback on the
                            product under development, the project team will have a better understanding of stakeholder
                            needs and expectations. This would help the team align the product based on the feedback,
                            thus reducing rework, and, as a result, reducing costs associated with such rework.<br>
                            D. Greater trust<br>
                            Incorrect. Regular stakeholder involvement and interactions with the team allow transparency
                            into project activities. This, in turn, results in greater trust between the stakeholders,
                            the project management team, and project team members.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            Cycle time is the time required to process a work item. This metric is typically used with a
                            Kanban board. Agile team members may combine a Kanban board to manage their workflow within
                            an iteration. By measuring various metrics, such as velocity, throughput, and work in
                            progress (WIP), the team may determine what combination would result in reduced cycle time
                            and implement the new values in the upcoming sprint, thus improving the overall project
                            performance. A formula that can be used to calculate cycle time is: Cycle time = WIP /
                            Throughput. Therefore, if the team can accelerate its throughput - this would be great.
                            However, the easiest way to reduce cycle time is to decrease work in progress (WIP). WIP is
                            the work started but not completed. Limiting the number of items in the queue would allow
                            the team to focus on a few items and deliver value faster and more frequently. WIP hides
                            bottlenecks and slows down throughput. To monitor progress, teams can use task boards and
                            set a limit to the number of items that can be worked on at the same time. The best
                            combination to reduce cycle time, if possible, is to decrease WIP and increase
                            throughput.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Decrease WIP and throughput<br>
                            Incorrect. Decreasing WIP is a good approach. However, decreasing throughput would not
                            result in a shorter cycle time. If the team decreases both WIP and throughput, the team may
                            end up with the same or even longer cycle time. While some combinations may result in
                            shorter cycle time, this determination cannot be reasonably supported without having
                            specific figures for the metrics used.<br>
                            B. Increase WIP, velocity, and throughout<br>
                            Incorrect. Although increasing velocity and throughout would likely result in shorter cycle
                            time, increasing the WIP at the same time may eventually negate the benefits of the
                            increased velocity, and the increased throughout. Without knowing the exact values by which
                            these three parameters are modified, determining the final result would be impossible.<br>
                            C. Increase WIP and throughput<br>
                            Incorrect. Increasing WIP will hide bottlenecks and increase cycle time. Increasing
                            throughput is a good idea as more people can work on tasks, remove roadblocks, and reduce
                            cycle time. However, it is not clear how this combination will ultimately affect cycle
                            time.<br>
                            D. Decrease WIP and increase throughput<br>
                            Correct. A decreased WIP means limiting the number of items in WIP, so the team can focus on
                            the roadblocks. Increasing throughput will reduce cycle time as the items would move through
                            the process faster. In combination, this will result in decreasing the cycle time.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            The scenario describes a project with a predictive phase followed by a Scrum phase, which
                            means that the overall project management framework is a hybrid. When using a traditional
                            waterfall approach, the tasks required to complete the required project work are typically
                            assigned to specific individuals and recorded in the project schedule. Agile teams are
                            self-organizing and self-managing, which is contrary to a predictive approach. When using an
                            agile model, the elements of the product are captured in a prioritized product backlog and
                            assigned at the team level rather than specific individuals. The team then collaborates to
                            complete the project work. Therefore, in this scenario, it would be most appropriate to
                            transition from individual to team-based performance criteria for recognition and
                            rewards.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Change the recognition criteria from individual performance to team-based performance<br>
                            Correct. When using agile methodologies, e.g., Scrum, as described in the scenario, the
                            project team has collective responsibility for completing the required work. It would be,
                            therefore, appropriate to transition from individual to team-based performance criteria.<br>
                            B. Recognize those individuals that effectively transition from T-shaped to I-shaped<br>
                            Incorrect. T-shaped people are generalizing specialists, and I-shaped people are
                            specialists. Agile teams that are comprised of generalizing specialists are typically more
                            successful than teams of specialists. Generalizing specialists offer greater flexibility,
                            which improves throughput. Recognizing I-shaped individuals would not be aligned with the
                            Scrum phase.<br>
                            C. Base the criteria on how effectively the team completes the scope as originally
                            planned<br>
                            Incorrect. Agile methodologies, such as Scrum, are characterized by high rates of change.
                            Agile principles embrace change for the customer's benefit. Therefore, when using an agile
                            framework, evaluating the project team on how well they complete the project scope as
                            originally planned would not be an appropriate measure of success.<br>
                            D. Reward the project team that completes the most story points within the organization<br>
                            Incorrect. A story point is a unit-less measure used to determine the relative size of user
                            stories. Typically, story points are unique to a project team and cannot be used as a
                            performance measure across projects and/or project teams.<br>

                          <div class="specificfeedback">Your answer is incorrect.<br>
                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            The question suggests that you are carrying out the Define Activities process. The project
                            documents created during this process include the activity list, activity attributes, and
                            milestone list. Activity attributes include activity codes, predecessor activities,
                            successor activities, logical relationships, leads and lags, resource requirements, imposed
                            dates, constraints, and assumptions. The description provided by the question indicates that
                            the activity attributes have been created. Note, the question disguises the word
                            ‘activities’ by providing its definition from the glossary of the PMBOK® Guide which reads,
                            “Activity. A distinct, scheduled portion of work performed during the course of a
                            project.”<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Activity list<br>
                            Incorrect. An activity list is a documented tabulation of schedule activities that shows the
                            activity description, activity identifier, and a sufficiently detailed scope of work
                            description, so project team members understand what work is to be performed. However, the
                            activity list does not describe the necessary sequence of events.<br>
                            B. Activity attributes<br>
                            Correct. Activity attributes include activity codes, predecessor activities, successor
                            activities, logical relationships, leads and lags, resource requirements, imposed dates,
                            constraints, and assumptions.<br>
                            C. Activity register<br>
                            Incorrect. ‘Activity register’ is a made-up term.<br>
                            D. Milestone list<br>
                            Incorrect. A milestone list is a significant point or event in a project. Although a
                            milestone list may contain a sequence of important events, it does not describe the logical
                            relationships between activities.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            The scenario describes a traditional waterfall project with the use of a work breakdown
                            structure (WBS) and a Gantt chart. However, the project manager is also incorporating the
                            agile concept of a self-organizing team and the use of a Kanban board. Incorporating
                            elements of agile practices within an overarching predictive model makes this project a
                            hybrid. Regardless of the background information provided, the question is asking for the
                            leadership style that uses inspirational motivation to empower the team through idealized
                            attributes and behaviors, which best describes the transformational leadership style. The
                            transformational leadership style is defined as empowering followers through idealized
                            attributes and behaviors, inspirational motivation, encouragement for innovation and
                            creativity, and individual consideration.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Adopt a Laissez-faire leadership style<br>
                            Incorrect. The Laissez-faire leadership style is described as allowing the team to make
                            their own decisions and establish their own goals. In this scenario, the project manager is
                            empowering the team with some decision making authority but is not allowing them to
                            establish their own goals. It is the project manager who assigns the work at a high
                            level.<br>
                            B. Incorporate the elements of a servant leader<br>
                            Incorrect. In this scenario, the project manager is incorporating some agile best practices
                            by empowering the team with the authority to make their own decisions regarding task
                            assignments. Servant leadership is the most effective leadership style when supporting an
                            agile team. However, the scenario describes a hybrid project, in which agile elements are
                            incorporated into an overall predictive model. Therefore, a different leadership style may
                            be more appropriate. More importantly, the question describes a different leadership
                            style.<br>
                            C. Utilize management by exception<br>
                            Incorrect. Management by exception best describes a transactional leadership style, e.g.,
                            focus on goals, feedback, and accomplishment to determine rewards. In the scenario, however,
                            the project manager is empowering the team rather than just managing by exception.<br>
                            D. Use a transformational leadership style<br>
                            Correct. The transformational leadership style is defined as empowering followers through
                            idealized attributes and behaviors, inspirational motivation, encouragement for innovation
                            and creativity, and individual consideration, which is what described in the scenario
                            provided.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            The question is in reference to the Tuckman ladder, which is one of the models used to
                            describe team development. This model includes five stages of development that teams may go
                            through including forming, storming, norming, performing, and adjourning. During the
                            adjourning phase of team development, the team completes the work and moves on from the
                            project. This stage is when staff is typically released as deliverables are completed or as
                            part of the Close Project or Phase process. Therefore, of the available choices, rewarding
                            the team with a celebration meeting and ensuring that the team members are reassigned is the
                            best way for you, as the project manager, to support the project team with the adjourning
                            stage of team development.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Reward the team with a celebration meeting and ensure that the team members are
                            reassigned<br>
                            Correct. During the adjourning phase of team development, the team completes the work and
                            moves on from the project. This stage is when staff is typically released as deliverables
                            are completed or as part of the Close Project or Phase process.<br>
                            B. Conduct a kick-off meeting so the team can learn about the project and their roles and
                            responsibilities<br>
                            Incorrect. This answer choice best supports the forming, rather than adjourning, stage of
                            team development. During the forming stage, team members meet and learn about the project
                            and their formal roles and responsibilities.<br>
                            C. Provide support as needed so the team can continue to function as a well-organized
                            unit<br>
                            Incorrect. This answer choice best supports the performing, rather than adjourning, stage of
                            team development. During the performing stage, the team functions as a well-organized unit
                            and work through issues smoothly and effectively.<br>
                            D. Utilize conflict management skills to ensure the environment does not become
                            counterproductive<br>
                            Incorrect. This answer choice best supports the storming, rather than adjourning, stage of
                            team development. During the storming stage, the team begins to address the project work,
                            technical decisions, and the project management approach. If the team members are not
                            collaborative, the environment can become counterproductive.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            Release burndown and burnup charts are tools that an agile project team can use to track the
                            project's progress against a release plan. A release burndown chart is updated at the end of
                            each sprint and displays the work remaining to complete the release. A release burnup chart
                            provides an additional detail that cannot be explicitly displayed on the burndown chart.
                            This additional detail is the changes in scope, which is exactly what the program manager
                            requested. The release burnup chat would allow the program manager to understand the overall
                            project performance in terms of work completed against the original scope and the scope
                            changes that have occurred during the release development.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Invite the program manager to attend the iteration review meeting<br>
                            Incorrect. Iteration review meetings are aimed to demonstrate the product increment
                            completed during the last iteration. Iteration review will be less helpful for the program
                            manager to understand the overall project progress.<br>
                            B. Suggest that the program manager participate in the daily standups<br>
                            Incorrect. Daily standup meetings are intended mainly for the team members to synchronize on
                            their work and report impediments to progress. Deriving the overall project status from the
                            daily standup meetings would be very unlikely possible. The time of the program manager can
                            be better spent elsewhere.<br>
                            C. Have the program manager view the iteration burndown chart<br>
                            Incorrect. The iteration burndown chart contains information about the current sprint only.
                            The iteration burndown chart does not show information regarding the overall project
                            status.<br>
                            D. Periodically send the release burnup chart to the program manager<br>
                            Correct. A release burnup chart has the same information displayed as a release burndown
                            chart. However, instead of displaying work remaining, it displays the work completed. The
                            main difference between the two is that the burnup chart can show changes in scope, which is
                            what the program manager requested.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            Predictive and agile project life cycles differ from one another in several aspects. One of
                            them is the way key stakeholders are involved. In predictive projects, key stakeholders are
                            typically involved at specific milestones, such as the project kick-off meeting, phase
                            gates, transition from project to operations, and other major milestones. At the other end
                            of the project life cycle continuum are agile projects, in which stakeholder involvement is
                            continuous. This means the stakeholders are involved in planning, on-going review and
                            feedback on the product increments, the performance of the project team, and even daily
                            standup meetings, when and if necessary. Hybrid projects, depending on their proximity to
                            predictive or agile approaches, will have their stakeholders involved more frequently than
                            just at specific milestones (as with the predictive projects), but less frequently than what
                            would have been described as a continuous involvement (as with the agile projects). For
                            example, unlike with predictive projects, stakeholders on hybrid projects can be involved at
                            milestones and, in addition, during planing, review, and delivery of the product subsets,
                            which is the delivery approach typical for hybrid projects. On the other hand, stakeholder
                            involvement on hybrid projects would be less frequent than constant involvement in agile
                            projects where key stakeholders continuously have their fingers on the pulse of the
                            project.<br>
                            One may argue that "regularly" is a subset of "continuously", making the two choices
                            plausible answers. While this is true, as far as the exam is concerned, we always have to
                            select the 'best' answer to the question asked. Of the two choices, in the context of the
                            scenario that describes a hybrid project, "regularly" means less frequently than
                            "continuously" (which is a characteristic of an agile project), and therefore, represents a
                            better answer choice.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Continuously<br>
                            Incorrect. Continuous involvement of key project stakeholders is one of the main
                            characteristics of agile projects. The stakeholders are involved in planning, on-going
                            review and feedback on the product increments, and the performance of the project team.
                            Another answer choice better describes the involvement of key stakeholders in hybrid
                            projects.<br>
                            B. At specific milestones<br>
                            Incorrect. It is the predictive rather than hybrid projects where the key stakeholders are
                            involved at specific milestones, such as the project kick-off meeting, phase gates,
                            transition from project to operations, and other major milestones. On hybrid projects, like
                            the one described in the scenario, key stakeholders are involved more frequently.<br>
                            C. Regularly<br>
                            Correct. Unlike predictive projects where stakeholders are involved at specific milestones
                            or agile projects where stakeholder involvement is continuous, hybrid projects, like the one
                            described in the scenario, take a combined approach, involving stakeholders regularly. This
                            means more often than only at specific milestones as with predictive projects, but not
                            continuously as on agile projects.<br>
                            D. Not involved at all<br>
                            Incorrect. It is highly unlikely that a project would not have its stakeholders involved.
                            This answer choice describes an almost unrealistic approach to stakeholder involvement.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            The way the question is framed implies that some parts of the project, at least engaging
                            with stakeholders and handling changes, are managed using traditional methods. This is
                            evident from the fact that the project manager submits a change request to modify
                            stakeholder engagement guidelines specified in the project management plan (likely in the
                            stakeholder engagement plan). Incorporating agile practices into a traditionally managed
                            project would result in a hybrid project. One of the agile practices is engaging with
                            stakeholders directly rather than going through layers of management. While it is unclear
                            from the scenario what exactly was the main source of stakeholder dissatisfaction, from the
                            choices provided, only engaging with stakeholders directly is an agile practice related to
                            stakeholder engagement and is, therefore, the best answer to the question asked.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Shielding the team from interruptions<br>
                            Incorrect. Shielding the team from interruptions is one of the servant leader's duties,
                            which is typical for projects that use an agile project management approach. However, it is
                            unclear if this action would improve the way stakeholders are engaged, which is the problem
                            presented by the scenario.<br>
                            B. Replacing the WBS with a product backlog<br>
                            Incorrect. Replacing the WBS with a product backlog indeed represents the incorporation of
                            agile practice. However, this action would only change the way the requirements on the
                            project are documented and managed. It is unclear if stakeholder satisfaction from how they
                            are engaged in the project would improve as a result of this replacement.<br>
                            C. Engaging with stakeholders directly<br>
                            Correct. One of the agile principles states that face-to-face communication is the most
                            efficient method of conveying information. Stakeholder engagement and communications are
                            closely related and depend on one another. Engaging with stakeholders directly reflects this
                            principle and, therefore, would hopefully improve stakeholder satisfaction.<br>
                            D. Delivering working software more frequently<br>
                            Incorrect. It is true that agile methods promote delivering working software frequently.
                            More frequent delivery would likely result in more frequent interactions with stakeholders.
                            However, there is not enough information in the scenario to determine whether the frequency
                            of delivering product increments is the main source of stakeholder dissatisfaction.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            Burndown charts track the work that remains to be completed over a predefined period of
                            time. A typical burndown chart tracks the number of story points completed in an iteration
                            or a release. In this scenario, during the iteration retrospective meeting, the project
                            manager and team are analyzing the burndown chart of the recently completed iteration. The
                            goal of the iteration retrospective is to reflect on the work performed and improve the
                            process going forward. Burndown charts can help analyze the team's velocity. Identifying
                            gaps in velocity and finding the reason for being unable to meet the iteration goal may
                            provide insight into what could be improved. For example, when the actual velocity is equal
                            to the planned one, the curve of the story points remaining to be completed overlaps the
                            curve of the planned work. When the velocity is slower than planned, the curves diverge.
                            When the team completes work faster than planned, the slope of the curve of the remaining
                            work is steeper than the planned curve.<br>
                            According to the iteration burndown chart presented in the scenario, right off the start,
                            during the first 2.5 days, the curve of the story points remained to be completed was
                            diverging from the plan, meaning the team's velocity was lower than the one needed to
                            complete the work planned for those days. From the middle of day 3 till the middle of day 5,
                            for whatever reason, the team completed no story points at all. As the iteration progressed,
                            the team's velocity varied and the number of the story points remaining to be completed went
                            down. However, at some point during that period (on day 7), the gap between planned and
                            actual work was at its maximum value of nearly 15 sorry points, significantly diverging from
                            the plan. Although towards the end of the iteration the team members were able to catch up a
                            bit, yet they failed to close the gap entirely, thus missing the iteration goal.<br>
                            Note, no calculation is required to answer this question. All is needed, is a simple visual
                            analysis of the burndown chart.<br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. A <br>
                            Incorrect. Area A represents approximately the first 2.5 days of the 10-day iteration. At
                            the beginning of the first day, the number of story points planned is the largest and equal
                            to the number of story points remaining to be completed. Therefore, the number of story
                            points actually completed is zero. By the end of the period represented by area A, the team
                            has completed approximately 5 story points, while it should have completed about 8. However,
                            this gap is still the smallest of those the team accumulated during any other periods
                            throughout the iteration.<br>
                            B. B <br>
                            Correct. Area B represents approximately the next 2 days of the iteration. The exact number
                            of days in this area is not important. What important is that the curve of the story points
                            remaining to be completed is flat, meaning the team did not complete any work at all.
                            Finding the reason for why this occurred may help the team improve the process going
                            forward.<br>
                            C. C <br>
                            Incorrect. Area C represents the longest period of the iteration, approximately 4 days.
                            During this period, the team accumulated the largest gap between the planned and actual
                            work. For example, one can see that on days 7 and 8, the gap was around 15 story points.
                            During this period, however, the team has completed the largest amount of work, between 15
                            to 20 story points.<br>
                            D. D <br>
                            Incorrect. Area D represents the last 1.5 days of the 10-day iteration. The curve of the
                            remaining story points is almost parallel to the one of the planned work, implying the team
                            had been completing the work at the originally planned velocity. By the end of the
                            iteration, the number of story points completed was the largest and the number of story
                            points remaining the smallest. However, due to the previous velocity gaps, the iteration
                            goal has not been met.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            Project exit criteria (also known as accomplishment criteria) defines the conditions that
                            need to be met in order to close or to cancel the project or phase. The scenario implies the
                            project is set up for failure if resources are unavailable to fulfill the project
                            requirements. By proactively identifying the risk of resources being unavailable,
                            establishing the project exit criteria early in the project, and documenting the criteria in
                            the project charter, the key project stakeholders would be aware of the circumstances. In
                            the event risk realizes, i.e., the resources are not available, the news would not come as a
                            surprise, and the project would not be considered a failure. If the project meets its exit
                            criteria, the project enters the Close Project or Phase process.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Issue a risk report<br>
                            Incorrect. The risk report is a project document that is first created as an output of the
                            Identify Risks process and then developed progressively throughout the Project Risk
                            Management processes This document summarizes information on individual project risks and
                            the level of overall project risk. While the risk report could have documented the risk of
                            resource unavailability, it is not the right place to specify the conditions for project
                            termination. Additionally, the risk report is typically not available during project
                            initiation.<br>
                            B. Develop a resource management plan<br>
                            Incorrect. The resource management plan establishes the approach for managing project
                            resources. The plan could include information on how best to secure resources for the
                            project; however, developing the plan does not address the essence of the question, which is
                            concerned with communicating the risk of resource unavailability to the project
                            stakeholders. Additionally, the resource management plan is created during project planning,
                            while the scenario describes a project in initiation.<br>
                            C. Terminate the project<br>
                            Incorrect. The question is concerned with communicating the potential risk of resource
                            unavailability to the key project stakeholders and ensuring this risk is documented as a
                            condition to project termination. Terminating the project at this point is a premature
                            action.<br>
                            D. Establish the project exit criteria<br>
                            Correct. Project exit criteria (also known as accomplishment criteria) describe the
                            conditions to be met in order to close or to cancel the project or phase and is included in
                            the project charter. By documenting these criteria, the key project stakeholders will be
                            aware of the resource unavailability as one of the conditions to terminate the project.<br>

                          <div class="specificfeedback">Your answer is correct.<br>
                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            There is not enough information in the scenario to determine the reason why the description
                            provided in the user story is insufficient to develop the feature. However, this information
                            is not required to answer the question correctly. All is needed here is the understanding of
                            the roles and responsibilities of various stakeholders in a typical agile project. The
                            project team is responsible for the development of the product. The scrum master/agile coach
                            (a.k.a., team facilitator) is a servant leader who motivates, inspires, and guides the team
                            toward the project objectives. The product owner is responsible for the definition of the
                            product to be developed by the team. Prioritizing the backlog and ensuring the backlog items
                            are sufficiently elaborated are among the product owner's responsibilities. Therefore, of
                            the choices provided, consulting with the product owner is the best answer to the question
                            asked.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Develop the feature based on the available information<br>
                            Incorrect. Developing software code based on insufficient information may result in an
                            incorrectly built feature. If this happens, the customer may not get all the value planned
                            to be delivered in the iteration, and the entire iteration goal might be at risk.<br>
                            B. Perform an architectural spike<br>
                            Incorrect. A spike is used for activities such as investigation, exploration, and
                            experimentation. While carrying out an architectural spike may look like a plausible option,
                            another answer choice better addresses the question asked.<br>
                            C. Return the item to the backlog and select another one<br>
                            Incorrect. Work items in the iteration backlog are prioritized according to their value to
                            the customer. The prioritization is done by the product owner for a reason. Returning the
                            item to the backlog and selecting another one defeats the purpose and may negatively impact
                            the iteration goal. In an extreme case, if the iteration is canceled, all items developed
                            before the cancellation can still be delivered to the customer. If a high priority item was
                            not developed, the value delivered to the customer would be lower.<br>
                            D. Consult with the product owner<br>
                            Correct. In agile projects, the product owner is responsible for the direction of the
                            product, the contents of the backlog, and its prioritization. If the information provided in
                            the backlog items is insufficient, the product owner should make a decision as to whether to
                            elaborate the user story to allow the team to develop it or reprioritize the backlog so that
                            the next user story to be developed is detailed enough for the team to work on it.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            The question implies that the Close Project or Phase process of the second phase of the
                            project is being carried out. The lessons learned register is a project document used to
                            record knowledge gained during a project (or phase) so that it can be used in the current
                            project and entered into the lessons learned repository at the end of the project or phase.
                            The question indicates that the knowledge gained came from the project documents of the
                            current phase, which suggests that the knowledge was previously captured in the lessons
                            learned register. As part of the Close Project or Phase process, the information from the
                            lessons learned register should be transferred to the lessons learned repository which is
                            what you should do before moving to the next phase of your project.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Increase the management reserves allocated to the third phase<br>
                            Incorrect. Management reserves are a specified amount of the project budget withheld for
                            management control purposes and are reserved for unforeseen work that is within the scope of
                            the project. A project manager needs an approved change request to increase the management
                            reserves. Also, increasing the management reserves for a subsequent phase based on the
                            ineffective risk responses of a previous phase is not good project management practice.<br>
                            B. Update the risk management plan for the third phase<br>
                            Incorrect. While updating the risk management plan for the third phase is a plausible
                            option, it is not the next step for you to take. First, all activities associated with the
                            closure of the second phase should be completed. Even then, the next phase of the project
                            does not start with the development or update of the risk management plan. Additionally,
                            risk responses for particular risks are specified in the risk register, not in the risk
                            management plan.<br>
                            C. Submit a change request to update the lessons learned register<br>
                            Incorrect. The lessons learned register is a project document that is not typically subject
                            to a formal change control process. While the lessons learned register might be updated as
                            part of the process described in the scenario, no change request is required to update this
                            document.<br>
                            D. Transfer the knowledge gained to the lessons learned repository<br>
                            Correct. The lessons learned repository is a store of historical information about lessons
                            learned from projects. As part of the Close Project or Phase process, the information from
                            the lessons learned register could be transferred to the lessons learned repository.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            The question suggests that a best practice was developed, which can improve the performance
                            of the Monitor Risks process. Updates to the organizational process assets are one of the
                            outputs of the Monitor Risks process. Organizational process assets may include templates
                            for project forms and documents. In this case, a template of the revised risk register may
                            be added to the organizational process assets or the existing risk register template could
                            be updated to the revised version. Organizational process assets, including templates, serve
                            as inputs for future projects. The incorrect answer choices represent actions that may or
                            may not influence the current project but would not directly affect future projects.
                            Therefore, among the available choices, updating the organizational process assets with a
                            revised risk register template is the best answer to the question asked.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Add a note to the best practices log for future reference<br>
                            Incorrect. 'Best practices log' is a fake project document made up for this question. Best
                            practices are an example of lessons learned which should be captured in the lessons learned
                            register.<br>
                            B. Record the information in the issue log<br>
                            Incorrect. The issue log is a project document where information about issues is recorded
                            and monitored. The issue log may be used for the current project but does not directly
                            affect future projects. Additionally, best practices are not recorded in the issue log.<br>
                            C. Submit a change request to update the risk management plan<br>
                            Incorrect. An approved change request is required to update the risk management plan, as it
                            is a component of the project management plan. However, the risk management plan is only
                            relevant to the current project and does not directly affect future projects.<br>
                            D. Update the organizational process assets<br>
                            Correct. Organizational process assets may include templates for project forms and
                            documents. In this case, a template of the revised risk register may be added to the
                            organizational process assets, or the existing risk register template could be updated to
                            the revised version.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            The purpose of the project described in the scenario is to improve the company's customer
                            service and, ultimately, increase customer satisfaction. Measurable project objectives and
                            related success criteria are an essential component of any project charter. Among the answer
                            choices, the only statement containing a metric with a number, making it measurable, is the
                            customer retention rate improvement of 10%. The identification of customer needs through a
                            survey to define the project scope is considered a high-level requirement, while the lack of
                            experience with the new technology to be used in the project poses an overall project risk.
                            The first release that is scheduled to be ready by a specific point in time as an
                            intermediate project result or milestone is part of the summary milestone schedule. It is
                            likely that a situation where sufficient market share improvement is reached is part of the
                            desired results that will allow closing the project or phase, i.e., the project exit
                            criteria.<br>

                          <div class="specificfeedback">Your answer is correct.<br>
                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            The question states that the cost performance index (CPI) is 0.9 and the schedule
                            performance index (SPI) is 1.2, which indicates that the project is running over budget and
                            ahead of schedule. Thus, you, as the project manager need to ensure that costs are brought
                            back into alignment with the cost baseline by the end of the project. Having just performed
                            the variance analysis, you should now seek to isolate and understand the variance in order
                            to ensure the appropriate action is taken. For example, it is possible that the cause of the
                            cost variance is the result of a one-time unexpected expenditure early in the project with
                            recent trend analysis indicating that the project should finish within the cost baseline and
                            no action is necessary. In any case, you should not take action until the issue is fully
                            understood along with the impacts of any efforts to further control costs. Therefore, of the
                            available choices, conducting further research to isolate and understand the variance from
                            the cost baseline is the best answer to the question asked.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Reduce the product features to bring costs back into alignment with the project
                            budget<br>
                            Incorrect. Cutting features from the product means that the project will not meet the scope
                            baseline as originally planned. The question states that it is critical that the project
                            meet 'all' project objectives which would include the project scope. The project manager
                            should first attempt to bring costs back into alignment with the cost baseline before
                            reducing scope. Additionally, an approved change request is required to modify the scope
                            baseline.<br>
                            B. Crash the schedule to bring the schedule in line with project objectives<br>
                            Incorrect. The question states that the schedule performance index (SPI) is 1.2 and the cost
                            performance index (CPI) is 0.9, which indicates that the project is running ahead of
                            schedule and over budget. Crashing the schedule will likely increase project costs which
                            will increase the cost variance.<br>
                            C. Conduct further research to isolate and understand the variance from the cost
                            baseline<br>
                            Correct. The question indicates that the project is currently running over budget. Project
                            cost control includes monitoring cost performance to isolate and understand variances from
                            the approved cost baseline. Before action is taken, you, as the project manager, should
                            fully understand the issue along with the impacts of any efforts to further control
                            costs.<br>
                            D. Release one of the developers to reduce costs<br>
                            Incorrect. Releasing one of the developers might decrease the cost variance going forward,
                            especially considering the project is running ahead of schedule. However, this is a
                            premature action and may impact other project constraints if the tasks assigned to the
                            developer cannot be performed by anyone else. First, the project manager should seek to
                            understand the cause of the cost variance to ensure that the appropriate action is taken,
                            which may or may not include releasing one of the developers.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            The purpose of a kick-off meeting is to communicate the objectives of the project, gain the
                            commitment of the team for the project, and explain the roles and responsibilities of each
                            stakeholder. Multiphase projects will typically include a kick-off meeting at the beginning
                            of each phase. Had the project manager conducted a kick-off meeting at the start of the
                            second phase, the phase objectives would have been made clear to the stakeholders, and the
                            confusion about stakeholder roles and responsibilities could have been reduced or
                            avoided.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Conducting a kick-off meeting at the start of each phase<br>
                            Correct. The purpose of a kick-off meeting is to communicate the objectives of the project,
                            gain the commitment of the team for the project, and explain the roles and responsibilities
                            of each stakeholder. Multiphase projects will typically include a kick-off meeting at the
                            beginning of each phase. Had the project manager conducted a kick-off meeting at the start
                            of the second phase, the problems described in the scenario would likely have been
                            avoided.<br>
                            B. Carrying out a team-building exercise with the project stakeholders<br>
                            Incorrect. The objective of team-building activities is to help individual team members work
                            together effectively by building trust and establishing good working relationships. While a
                            team-building exercise may help raise the commitment level of stakeholders, the
                            team-building exercise is not typically used to provide information about phase objectives
                            and roles and responsibilities.<br>
                            C. Conducting the project in a single phase<br>
                            Incorrect. Although conducting the project in a single phase could have avoided the
                            situation from happening in the first place, this answer choice does not address the issue
                            at hand: a confusion among the project stakeholders regarding the phase objectives and their
                            roles and responsibilities on a project that has already entered its second phase.<br>
                            D. Assigning a different project manager for each phase of the project<br>
                            Incorrect. There is no information in the question which suggests that assigning a different
                            project manager would have avoided the problem outlined in the scenario. The question
                            implies that an important step was overlooked when dealing with a multiphase project.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            In agile projects, project managers are supposed to demonstrate servant leadership virtues.
                            Servant leaders are good listeners. In the situation described, the project manager, as a
                            servant leader, should first listen to what the team members have to say and, without making
                            any immediate and uninformed decisions, absorb the frustration of the team members. Agile
                            servant leaders should not blame or criticize the team for not being able to deal with
                            issues. Rather, they should explain that challenges and difficulties are a common thing for
                            new and complex projects, and suggest ways for how to improve the situation. Ideally,
                            absorbing the frustration of the team members 'and' suggesting a solution would be a better
                            answer choice. However, this option is not provided. Therefore, of the available choices,
                            absorbing the frustration of the team is the best answer to the question asked.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Submit a change request<br>
                            Incorrect. First, there is not enough information in the scenario to determine if a change
                            request is needed and for what. Second, according to the scenario, the project is managed
                            using agile methods. In agile projects, changes are typically addressed by prioritizing the
                            product backlog.<br>
                            B. Absorb the frustration of the team members<br>
                            Correct. Servant leadership is a pinnacle of agile leaders. Servant leaders motivate and
                            inspire teams. When needed, a servant leader acts as a mom and dad for the team members to
                            absorb the frustration of their "kids". Sometimes, a sympathetic ear is all you need to let
                            off your steam.<br>
                            C. Escalate the issue to management<br>
                            Incorrect. Escalating the issue to the management right away is a premature action. Agile
                            leaders are expected to resolve issues that are under their control. If the issue cannot be
                            resolved, then the escalation to the management can be considered as the next step.<br>
                            D. Refer the team members to the product owner<br>
                            Incorrect. The primary responsibility of the product owner is to guide the direction of the
                            product. Some issues described in the scenario, such as changing priorities, are related to
                            the product owner's sphere of influence. However, the main problem presented in the question
                            is the psychological issues, such as stress and frustration, that the team members are
                            experiencing. Referring the team members to the product owner would not be the first thing
                            for the project manager to do in this scenario,<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            The scenario implies you are developing a quality management plan. The lessons learned
                            repository is one of the organizational process assets that can be used as an input to this
                            process. According to the scenario, most of the project management processes have been
                            properly performed on all of the past projects, suggesting past projects have been lead
                            using the predictive project management approach. When such an approach is used, quality
                            activities are typically performed toward the end of the project. Therefore, quality issues
                            are likely to be detected late in the project life cycle. One way to detect quality issues
                            early is to incorporate some agile practices into the quality processes. Incorporating agile
                            methods into a traditionally managed project will result in the hybrid project management
                            approach. For example, holding recurring retrospectives may help check the effectiveness of
                            the quality processes, look for the root cause of the issues, and then suggest new
                            approaches to improve quality. Retrospectives are typically associated with iterations.
                            While the scenario does not specify whether or not the product will be developed
                            iteratively, of the choices provided, holding recurring retrospectives is the best answer to
                            the question asked.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Estimate costs more accurately<br>
                            Incorrect. Estimating costs more accurately may help with better planning of the project
                            budget. However, it is unclear if this action would help detect quality issues earlier in
                            the project life cycle, as requested by the scenario.<br>
                            B. Validate scope on a daily basis<br>
                            Incorrect. The scope is typically validated when a deliverable is completed. It is unlikely
                            that the project will produce deliverables on a daily basis, warranting daily scope
                            validation. Even if this is possible, quality should be checked first before the deliverable
                            can be validated. What good does validating the scope do if the quality is not met?<br>
                            C. Conduct recurring retrospectives<br>
                            Correct. Recurring retrospectives is an agile/hybrid practice that reflects on work
                            performed, evaluates the processes, and suggests any improvements. By conducting recurring
                            retrospectives, quality issues can be detected earlier in the project life cycle comparing
                            to the traditional methods where quality is checked toward the end of the project.<br>
                            D. Hire an external quality vendor<br>
                            Incorrect. Whether quality checks are done internally or externally, it is the process, not
                            who performs it, determines how frequently and early the quality activities are incorporated
                            into the quality management practices of the organization or a project.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            It is important to note that the project manager was promoted to sponsor after successfully
                            managing past similar projects. One can make the reasonable assumption that she has the
                            necessary expertise in project management principles and practices to carry out an analogous
                            or top-down project estimate. By using this technique, the project sponsor should be able to
                            provide the steering committee with enough information for a review of the project. Later,
                            once the project enters the planning stage, any rough order of magnitude (ROM) estimates
                            created in initiation (-25% to +75%) should be revisited by the project manager and updated
                            with new information to create definitive estimates (-5% to +10%).<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Get a professional estimate from external subject matter experts<br>
                            Incorrect. While this option presents a good idea, it is not the best choice since it
                            involves the use of ‘external’ subject matter experts (SMEs). No project budget or funds
                            have been committed to the project yet, nor is it clear from the question if any SMEs are
                            available at such short notice. Moreover, the sponsor should first check the organization’s
                            process assets library to find any relevant information that could be used in their project
                            before seeking outside (likely paid) advice from experts.<br>
                            B. Use her own expert judgment and some historical information<br>
                            Correct. This answer choice describes analogous or top-down estimating. Analogous estimating
                            is a technique to estimate the duration or cost of an activity or project using historical
                            information. Analogous estimating is appropriate when the items being estimated are similar
                            in nature, and those preparing the estimates have the needed expertise. Since the project
                            sponsor is described as being successful in managing her past projects, it is reasonable to
                            assume that she has the skills necessary to provide the steering committee with a
                            preliminary project estimate using this technique.<br>
                            C. Use the WBS to create an accurate bottom-up estimate<br>
                            Incorrect. Bottom-up estimating uses the greatest level of specific detail available.
                            Detailed estimates are then “rolled up” to higher levels for subsequent reporting and
                            tracking purposes. Since the project is in the initiation, the work breakdown structure
                            (WBS) is not yet available; therefore, creating a bottom-up estimate is unlikely to be a
                            plausible option.<br>
                            D. Work with the project team to create the requested estimate<br>
                            Incorrect. The scenario implies that the project is still in the initiation. Therefore, it
                            is unlikely that any of the team members are available to assist in the estimating process
                            (unless some are already pre-assigned, but this cannot be determined from the information
                            given). While a better answer choice would have been to task the assigned project manager
                            with providing a rough order of magnitude (ROM) estimate, that option is not provided.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            On projects that have an assigned business analyst, eliciting, documenting and managing
                            stakeholder requirements is the responsibility of that role. The business analyst has the
                            unique skill set and expertise to do the requirements-related work, whereas the senior
                            programmers would likely be responsible for executing project deliverables to meet the
                            business requirements. The project manager may work closely with the business analyst,
                            especially on such a small project team, but is focused on overseeing the requirements
                            management process and its integration with the overall project. The project manager in this
                            scenario is fulfilling that responsibility by reviewing the requirements documentation, but
                            it is the business analyst who is responsible for gathering and documenting the business
                            requirements.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. The customer<br>
                            Incorrect. The customer will likely provide the requirements to the performing organization.
                            However, it is the representative of the performing organization (the business analyst in
                            the scenario described) who is responsible for gathering and documenting business
                            requirements.<br>
                            B. The project manager<br>
                            Incorrect. The project manager provides overall coordination and oversight of the
                            requirements management process. This includes ensuring that requirements-related work is
                            accounted for in the project management plan and ensuring that requirements-related
                            activities are performed on time and within budget and deliver value. However, it's the
                            business analyst who is responsible for analyzing, defining, documenting and managing
                            requirements.<br>
                            C. The developers<br>
                            Incorrect. For successful projects, there should be a clear delineation of roles and
                            responsibilities within the project team to avoid unnecessary confusion, overlap, or
                            inefficiency. The developers, as the name implies, are individuals who develop the product
                            based on the requirements collected and documented by a business analyst.<br>
                            D. The business analyst<br>
                            Correct. On projects with an assigned business analyst, requirements-related activities are
                            the responsibility of that role. The business analyst specializes in conducting business
                            analysis and is responsible for analyzing, defining, documenting and managing requirements,
                            while the project manager ensures that requirements-related activities are accounted for in
                            the project management plan and are performed on time and within budget and deliver
                            value.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            A root cause analysis can assist in identifying the root causes of a problem and solutions
                            for change. In the scenario, it seems as if transportation expenses are the highest costs.
                            Therefore, starting with the analysis of this expense makes the most sense. By using root
                            cause analysis, the underlying reason(s) for the high expenses can be determined, and a
                            solution can be identified.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Perform a root cause analysis<br>
                            Correct. Root cause analysis is an analytic technique used to determine the underlying
                            reason for a problem. This technique will help you identify the causes of high
                            transportation costs and develop a solution.<br>
                            B. Conduct a cost reduction analysis<br>
                            Incorrect. 'Cost reduction analysis' is a made-up term.<br>
                            C. Carry out a trend analysis<br>
                            Incorrect. Trend analysis is used to forecast future performance based on past results and
                            gives a project manager an early warning if there may be problems. In this scenario, you
                            already have a request to cut costs, so you don't need an early warning. Since you need to
                            decide how to reduce costs, not forecast future performance, a trend analysis will not be
                            helpful.<br>
                            D. Use a decision tree analysis<br>
                            Incorrect. Decision trees are used to support the selection of the best of several
                            alternative courses of action. At this point in the scenario, you know that the
                            transportation costs are excessive, but you have not determined any solutions to reduce the
                            costs. Therefore, decision tree analysis will not be useful until you have alternative ideas
                            from which to choose to reduce transportation costs.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            To answer the question correctly, it is important to interpret the last sentence of the
                            question, "What is the efficiency that must be maintained...?" The efficiency that must be
                            maintained is the to-complete-performance-index (TCPI). The TCPI is defined as a measure of
                            the cost performance that is required to be achieved with the remaining resources in order
                            to meet a specified management goal, expressed as the ratio of the cost to finish the
                            outstanding work to the remaining budget. The management goal in the question is "to
                            complete the project with the current EAC". The PMBOK® Guide specifies two scenarios to
                            calculate the TCPI:<br>
                            The efficiency that must be maintained to complete the project on plan, i.e., with the
                            original budget at completion (BAC): TCPI = (BAC - EV) / (BAC - AC)<br>
                            The efficiency that must be maintained in order to complete the project with the current
                            estimate at completion (EAC): TCPI = (BAC - EV) / (EAC - AC)<br>
                            Since the question is asking about the efficiency that must be maintained to complete the
                            project with the current estimate at completion (EAC), the EAC-based formula must be
                            used.<br>
                            The BAC is the initial project budget, $20,000. The project's current earned value (EV) is
                            $15,000, which is calculated by multiplying the actual percent complete, 75% (or 0.75) by
                            the BAC, $20,000: EV = 0.75 * $20,000 = $15,000. The EAC has already been calculated by the
                            project manager in the scenario as $22,667, and the actual cost (AC) is $17,000.
                            Therefore:<br>
                            TCPI = (BAC - EV) / (EAC - AC) = ($20,000 - $15,000) / ($22,667 - $17,000) = $5,000 / $5,667
                            = 0.882<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. 1.667<br>
                            Incorrect. This value has been calculated using the BAC-based formula: TCPI = (BAC - EV) /
                            (BAC - AC), while the question is asking to calculate the TCPI considering the project will
                            be completed with the current EAC.<br>
                            B. 1.353<br>
                            Incorrect. This value has been calculated using the following formula: TCPI = (EAC - EV) /
                            (EAC - AC). This is a made-up formula not specified in the PMBOK® Guide.<br>
                            C. 1.133<br>
                            Incorrect. This value has been calculated using the following formula: TCPI = (EAC - AC) /
                            (BAC - EV). This is a made-up formula not specified in the PMBOK® Guide.<br>
                            D. 0.882<br>
                            Correct. Since the estimate at completion (EAC) is $22,667, and the question is asking about
                            the efficiency that must be maintained in order to complete the project with the current
                            EAC, the correct formula to use in this scenario is: TCPI = (BAC - EV) / (EAC - AC). When
                            calculating the TCPI based on the EAC, the result will be 0.882.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            The question indicates that the project exists within a centralized (also called functional)
                            organizational structure. Within a centralized organization, the project manager has little
                            or no direct control over resources. If the project manager needs to acquire an employee
                            from within the company, the project manager will need to negotiate the reassignment of the
                            employee to the project. Therefore, of the available choices, the project manager should
                            first negotiate with the employee's functional manager to release the employee to work on
                            the project.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Submit a change request to update the schedule baseline<br>
                            Incorrect. Before such a step, the project manager should make every reasonable effort to
                            keep to the schedule baseline (e.g. acquire new team member, compress schedule, use overtime
                            options, fill the gap with existing team members).<br>
                            B. Negotiate with the employee's functional manager<br>
                            Correct. Within a centralized organization, the functional manager has control over
                            resources. If the project manager needs to acquire an employee from within the company, the
                            project manager needs to negotiate with the functional manager.<br>
                            C. Discuss the staffing situation with the project sponsor<br>
                            Incorrect. Before escalating this issue with the project sponsor, the project manager should
                            first attempt to acquire the identified employee from the functional manager.<br>
                            D. Reassign the identified employee to the project team<br>
                            Incorrect. Within the centralized type of organizational structure, the project manager has
                            little or no control over project resources. Therefore, the project manager will not have
                            the authority to reassign the identified employee.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            When including items into the product backlog, the product owner should consider different
                            factors, such as new features, risks associated with these features, risks associated with
                            other technical aspects, defects from previous releases or iterations, value to the
                            customer, etc. Defects are treated as product backlog items. Rather than creating a separate
                            backlog for defects, defects can be included in the product backlog. Maintaining two
                            separate backlogs (one for features, another for defects) is an ineffective way and may lead
                            to waste, which goes against agile best practices. Risks associated with the development of
                            the new features or with any other technical aspects related to the design or the
                            architecture of the new system should be treated as backlog items as well because they may
                            result in risk-based or architectural spikes that should be estimated and executed by the
                            development team.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Consider factors such as new features, risks, and defects<br>
                            Correct. New features, risks associated with these new features, or other technical risks,
                            defects to be fixed, are among the different factors that the product owner has to consider
                            when adding items to the product backlog.<br>
                            B. Build the backlog from the work breakdown structure (WBS)<br>
                            Incorrect. The work breakdown structure (WBS) is a hierarchical decomposition of the total
                            scope of work to be carried out by the project team to accomplish the project objectives and
                            create the required deliverables. The WBS is typically used in traditionally managed
                            projects or can be used in hybrid projects. In the scenario, the project is agile.<br>
                            C. Consult with the sponsor on how to add items to the backlog<br>
                            Incorrect. The product owner is ultimately responsible for the content and the
                            prioritization of the product backlog. While the sponsor may provide some insights related
                            to the project deliverables, sponsors are typically not involved in creating and/or
                            prioritizing the product backlog.<br>
                            D. Let the team decide on what should be added to the backlog<br>
                            Incorrect. The product owner works in cooperation with the team to create the product
                            backlog. However, it is the ultimate responsibility of the product owner (not the team
                            members) to define what items should be included in the product backlog and how they should
                            be prioritized.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            The scenario suggests that a hybrid lifecycle is being employed with the use of baselines
                            combined with sprints. When applying the schedule performance index (SPI) to sprints, the
                            SPI can be calculated as the story points completed divided by the story points associated
                            with the sprint goal. The team has been completing 50 story points per sprint with a goal of
                            60 points for an SPI of 0.83 (50 / 60 = 0.83). When using Scrum (as is suggested with the
                            use of sprints), the team commits during sprint planning to the number of story points to be
                            completed in the upcoming sprint. Despite falling short of their sprint goals, the project
                            is still on schedule. Since the team has established a stable velocity of 50 story points
                            per sprint, it is unrealistic to keep committing to completing 60 points, especially in
                            light of the fact that the team's current velocity has kept the project on schedule.
                            Although it would not be appropriate for the project manager to direct the team to lower
                            their sprint goal, the project manager should provide guidance that the sprint goal of 60
                            points might not be realistic based on the team's velocity of 50 points per sprint.<br>
                            Note, the fact the project is trending to meet all of the baselines but the SPI is 0.83
                            might seem to contradict. In reality, it does not. All it means is that the team likely
                            over-committed by planning 60 story points per sprint. Therefore, if the team indeed
                            completed 60 points per sprint, the project would have been ahead of schedule. In the
                            scenario, the team completed 50 points, so the SPI is less than 1.0, but the project is
                            still on schedule.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Submit a change request to revise the project schedule baseline<br>
                            Incorrect. The scenario states that the project is trending to meet all of the baselines,
                            which would include the schedule baseline. Therefore, there would be no reason to revise the
                            schedule baseline based on the information provided.<br>
                            B. Suggest that the team set more realistic goals during sprint planning<br>
                            Correct. It seems as if the team over-committed by planning 60 story points per sprint.
                            Since the team has established a stable velocity of 50 story points per sprint, it is
                            unrealistic to keep committing to completing 60 points, all else being equal.<br>
                            C. Crash the schedule in order to get productivity back on track<br>
                            Incorrect. The question stipulates that the project is trending to meet all of the
                            baselines, which would include the schedule baseline. Crashing the schedule is not warranted
                            and will increase costs, which might jeopardize the cost baseline.<br>
                            D. Assign the team 60 story points for each sprint going forward<br>
                            Incorrect. If the development team were to increase velocity to 60 points per sprint and
                            retain the same sprint goal of 60 points, the result would be an SPI of 1.0. However, the
                            question implies that a hybrid framework is being used with the incorporation of Scrum for
                            product development. With Scrum, the project team determines the sprint goal rather than the
                            project manager assigning story points. More importantly, the project team has already set a
                            sprint goal of 60 and is falling short each sprint (50 / 60 = 0.83).<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            The scenario describes a hybrid project that will be accomplished in two phases: an early
                            release of the product to the target end-users, a product that will be developed
                            incrementally using agile practices, and a second phase that will be conducted using the
                            predictive project management approach. A minimum viable product (MVP) is a powerful concept
                            that allows organizations to test their ideas. The initial development effort for an MVP
                            concentrates solely on those features absolutely necessary for successful deployment of the
                            product. Once this initial product is developed, it is exposed to a subset of the target
                            users to collect relevant data about the product to determine if it is 'viable' and if the
                            company should move forward with the full-blown development of the product. Since the lack
                            of knowledge, uncertainty, and risk are closely related, the MVP is often viewed as a risk
                            reduction tool.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Agile release planning<br>
                            Incorrect. Agile release planning is an example of the tools and techniques that can be used
                            as part of the Develop Schedule process. Agile release planning provides a high-level
                            summary timeline of the release schedule based on the product roadmap and the product vision
                            for the product's evolution. The release planning is a process, while the scenario describes
                            a product increment that has been released to the end-users.<br>
                            B. Minimum viable product<br>
                            Correct. A minimal viable product is the result of an initial development effort that
                            concentrates solely on those features absolutely necessary for the successful deployment of
                            an early version of a product.<br>
                            C. Fully functioning prototype<br>
                            Incorrect. A prototype, whether fully or partially functioning, is an original type, form,
                            or instance of a product to explore the basic size, look and feel of a product without
                            simulating the detailed functionality of the product. Prototypes are typically not released
                            to the end-users but instead are used internally by the performing organization for further
                            research and development.<br>
                            D. Work breakdown structure<br>
                            Incorrect. A work breakdown structure (WBS) is a hierarchical decomposition of the total
                            scope of work to be carried out by the project team to accomplish the project objectives and
                            created the required deliverables. A WBS is not "released" to target users.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            It is the team members, not managers/leaders, who actually produce the product/service of
                            the project and create business value for the customer. However, providing the tools and
                            resources needed by the team, removing impediments to progress, supporting the team members
                            to maximize their productivity, allocating resources for training, facilitating discussions,
                            and, ultimately, demonstrating a commitment to serve and put team members' interests first,
                            is the responsibility of an agile leader. Monitoring and enhancing focus, personal safety,
                            well-being, and communications within teams are among the tasks agile leaders are expected
                            to perform to improve team performance and, ultimately, enhance the chances of project's
                            success.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Set goals for what will be accomplished during each iteration<br>
                            Incorrect. Setting goals for what will be accomplished during each iteration is the
                            responsibility of the team in collaboration with the product owner (who typically represents
                            the customer), not the manager/leader. A manager/leader, such as the scrum master, agile
                            coach, etc., may facilitate discussions, help resolve conflicts and set direction; however,
                            the technical expertise lies with the team members.<br>
                            B. Enhance focus, personal safety, and communications within teams<br>
                            Correct. The main responsibility of the team members is to determine what could be done
                            within an iteration and complete the work that they committed to. Agile leaders may help
                            teams in accomplishing these goals by enhancing focus, personal safety, and communications
                            within the team.<br>
                            C. Maintain confidentiality by only sharing project progress with the project team<br>
                            Incorrect. Providing high visibility of project progress to all stakeholders is one of the
                            tasks agile leaders are expected to perform. Not sharing project information outside of the
                            project team is an anti-pattern. Agile methods promote transparency by openly sharing
                            information radiators with the organization.<br>
                            D. Protect teams from customer input that would change prioritization of project work<br>
                            Incorrect. Shielding the team from interruptions is one of the primary duties of servant
                            leaders. However, customer input (typically represented by the product owner) is the main
                            source of prioritization on agile projects. Therefore, protecting the team from customer
                            input is unlikely to be the point of argument with the executive.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            Technical performance analysis is used as a tool in the Monitor Risks process, and it may
                            expose the degree of technical risk faced by the project. Technical performance analysis
                            examines the technical accomplishments of the project and determines if they are progressing
                            according to the plan. In this scenario, this analysis would be used to compare actual
                            results, such as transaction times, against performance targets. Since the project manager
                            has collected technical performance measurements in the form of transaction data, the next
                            step is to conduct technical performance analysis.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Implement the fallback plan<br>
                            Incorrect. Implementing a fallback plan is a premature action until the data for transaction
                            times can be evaluated to determine the effectiveness of the risk response.<br>
                            B. Update the risk report with the new information<br>
                            Incorrect. The risk report may or may not be updated with information regarding the
                            effectiveness of a particular risk response. However, the transaction time data needs to be
                            analyzed before any conclusions can be drawn to include in a risk report.<br>
                            C. Report the findings to the stakeholders in accordance with the communications management

                            Incorrect. The raw data of transaction times is not likely to be communicated to
                            stakeholders. The data needs to be analyzed first to provide some context for the data.<br>
                            D. Use technical performance analysis to evaluate the transaction time data<br>
                            Correct. Technical performance analysis can be used to compare actual results, such as
                            transaction times, against targets. The results of the technical performance analysis can
                            provide context for the raw data that has been collected.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            The scenario describes a large organization with departmental silos and with specialized
                            contributors. With the work decomposed in departmental silos, the organization is not
                            structured to facilitate agile methodologies. Additionally, the employees will require
                            training, not only in agile best practices but also to become generalizing specialists to
                            better support agility. This type of transformation will not happen overnight, and
                            attempting to do so will likely result in the failure of the transition. A more appropriate
                            approach would be to begin introducing agile practices gradually within the existing
                            predictive model. Over time, projects can include more agile elements and less predictive
                            until the organization can adopt agile exclusively. When agile practices are incorporated
                            into a predictive model, the project becomes a hybrid framework.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Use hybrid life cycles as a transition strategy from predictive to agile<br>
                            Correct. A large and complex organization will likely require a gradual approach to
                            transition from predictive to agile methodologies. Incorporating elements of agile within
                            the existing predictive framework will allow for the gradual adoption and acceptance of
                            agile methods.<br>
                            B. Establish a fixed date for all projects to transition from predictive to agile<br>
                            Incorrect. A large organization that is steeped in the predictive model may have great
                            difficulty in transitioning to agile methodologies, particularly if the organization is
                            siloed, and the employees are specialized contributors. It would be more appropriate to
                            establish a gradual transformation rather than attempt to convert the organization from
                            waterfall to agile overnight. This approach is not likely to be successful.<br>
                            C. Introduce some agile techniques on a large and complex project<br>
                            Incorrect. The project manager might want to introduce some agile techniques into existing
                            projects as a technique to begin the agile transformation. However, it would not be
                            appropriate to take this action with a large and complex project. Instead, it would be
                            better to start with a less risky project.<br>
                            D. Tailor projects so that the scope is fixed with time and cost being variable<br>
                            Incorrect. This answer choice represents the traditional triangle of constraints rather than
                            agile. Although scope, schedule, and budget are all fixed with baselines, the scope is
                            typically established during initial project planning, and the project may come in
                            over/under budget for schedule and cost. Therefore, this strategy likely represents the
                            current state and would do nothing to transition the organization from a predictive model to
                            agile.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            The choice of media is one of the considerations for effective communication. The choice of
                            media includes decisions about the application of communications artifacts to meet specific
                            project needs, such as when to communicate in writing versus orally, when to prepare an
                            informal memo versus a formal report, and when to use push/pull options as the choice of
                            appropriate technology. In this case, the project manager should have followed up the phone
                            conversation (informal oral communication) with formal written communication in the form of
                            an updated contract or an addendum to the existing contract instead of relying on informal
                            oral communication. With informal oral communication, there is no record of what agreements
                            were made. Additionally, an oral contract, as suggested by the question, cannot supersede a
                            written contract from a legal standpoint. Therefore, of the available choices, following up
                            the phone conversation with a different choice of media is the best way the issue could have
                            been avoided.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Used active listening skills to ensure understanding<br>
                            Incorrect. Active listening involves acknowledging, clarifying and confirming understanding,
                            and removing barriers that adversely affect comprehension. The question does not elaborate
                            on the extent to which active listening skills were employed by the project manager.
                            However, there is no indication in the question that there was a misunderstanding between
                            the customer's authorized representative and the project manager. The main problem was the
                            fact that the project manager failed to capture the verbal agreement in the form of a formal
                            written agreement. Therefore, it is unlikely that the lack of active listening skills is
                            what contributed to the problem presented by the question.<br>
                            B. Followed up the phone conversation with a different choice of media<br>
                            Correct. The choice of media includes decisions such as when to communicate in writing
                            versus orally. The project manager should have followed up the phone conversation with an
                            updated contract instead of relying on an oral agreement. If the project manager had
                            selected the appropriate choice of media, the issue could have been avoided.<br>
                            C. Declined the customer's request as it is an example of scope creep<br>
                            Incorrect. Scope creep is the uncontrolled expansion of product or project scope without
                            adjustments to time, cost, and resources. In this case, the additional scope was requested
                            by the customer, and the change request was approved. Therefore, the added functionality
                            does not represent scope creep. Although declining the request may have prevented the
                            problem which developed later, there is no valid reason presented by the question for the
                            project manager to decline the customer's request, and this is not the best way that the
                            project manager could have avoided the dispute with the customer.<br>
                            D. Incorporated interactive communication to ensure a common understanding<br>
                            Incorrect. Interactive communication involves two (or more) parties performing a
                            multidirectional exchange of information in real time. A phone call, as described in this
                            scenario, is an example of interactive communication. Since interactive communication was
                            already used in this situation, but the problem still occurred, incorporating interactive
                            communication could not have prevented the problem described by the question.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            A project charter template is typically found in the organizational process assets. Even
                            though templates can also be found on websites and commercial databases, which are
                            considered enterprise environmental factors, the first place to check is the organizational
                            process assets to see if an approved template is available.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Project business case<br>
                            Incorrect. The business case is a documented economic feasibility study used to justify the
                            project, and it is used as an input into the Develop Project Charter process. However, the
                            business case is not a source for project templates.<br>
                            B. Enterprise environmental factors<br>
                            Incorrect. Templates for a project charter can be found on websites and in commercial
                            databases, which are considered enterprise environmental factors. However, this is not the
                            first place to check for a template. An approved template of a project charter may exist
                            among the organizational process assets.<br>
                            C. Benefits management plan<br>
                            Incorrect. The benefits management plan is the documented explanation defining the processes
                            for creating, maximizing, and sustaining the benefits provided by a project. The benefits
                            management plan is an input for the development of the project charter, but it does not
                            contain templates.<br>
                            D. Organizational process assets<br>
                            Correct. A project charter template is typically found in the organizational process assets,
                            and this is the first place to check and see if an approved template is already
                            available.<br>

                          <div class="specificfeedback">Your answer is correct.<br>
                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            The question suggests that you have just drafted the project charter, which is the main
                            output of the Develop Project Charter process. The project charter is a document which, at a
                            high-level, ensures a common understanding by the stakeholders of key deliverables,
                            milestones, and the roles and responsibilities of everyone involved in the project. Although
                            a project manager may assist with the development of the project charter, the charter must
                            still be formally approved by an initiating entity such as a sponsor, project management
                            office (PMO), or authorized representative. Therefore, before wrapping up the Develop
                            Project Charter process, you should obtain approval of the project charter.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Obtain approval of the document you have drafted<br>
                            Correct. The question suggests that the project charter has just been drafted. The project
                            charter must be formally signed-off by the project initiator before the Develop Project
                            Charter process described by the scenario can be completed.<br>
                            B. Conduct a project kick-off meeting<br>
                            Incorrect. The question indicates that the project still needs to be formally authorized
                            through the approval of the project charter, which means that conducting a project kick-off
                            meeting at this point would be premature. A kick-off meeting typically takes place at the
                            end of planning and the start of executing. According to the scenario, the project is in
                            initiation.<br>
                            C. Obtain approval of the project management plan<br>
                            Incorrect. The question implies that the project charter has just been drafted. Before the
                            development of the project management plan can begin, the project charter should be approved
                            as it serves as an input to the Develop Project Management Plan process.<br>
                            D. Pre-assign key project team members<br>
                            Incorrect. When physical or team resources are determined in advance, before the actual
                            process of acquiring project resources begins, the resources are considered pre-assigned.
                            There is not enough information in the question to determine if any resources should or
                            could be pre-assigned. Additionally, pre-assignment can take place later in the project life
                            cycle, not necessarily during project initiation.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            Having a prioritized project backlog is essential to delivering the optimal value to the
                            customer. A prioritized backlog helps guide the development team to build the highest value
                            features first, so the customer can start realizing the greatest value as early as possible.
                            With agile project management, specifically Scrum, the product owner serves as the voice of
                            the customer and is responsible for prioritizing the product backlog. In this scenario, the
                            newly assigned product owner is not likely to have the knowledge to effectively perform
                            their role since the product owner role does not typically exist within a predictive
                            environment. The project manager should ensure that the product owner is adequately trained
                            to perform their role effectively.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Assign story points to prioritize the product backlog<br>
                            Incorrect. Story points are used to estimate the items in the product backlog, not to
                            prioritize them. Items in the backlog are prioritized based on their value to the customer.
                            The prioritization is the ultimate responsibility of a product owner, assuming one is
                            assigned to the project.<br>
                            B. Request that the team use the MoSCoW method<br>
                            Incorrect. The MoSCoW method is a prioritization technique that might be useful in
                            prioritizing the product backlog to ensure the most valuable features are developed first.
                            However, it is the product owner, not the development team, that is ultimately responsible
                            for prioritizing the product backlog.<br>
                            C. Schedule scrum training for the product owner<br>
                            Correct. The product owner is ultimately responsible for prioritizing the product backlog to
                            ensure that the most valuable features are delivered first. Therefore, it will be critical
                            that the product owner has the appropriate training to perform their role effectively. Since
                            the new project will use Scrum, scrum training would best meet this need.<br>
                            D. Decompose the WBS into scrum user stories<br>
                            Incorrect. The work breakdown structure (WBS) is decomposed down to the work package level.
                            User stories represent items in the product backlog, not in the WBS. Additionally,
                            decomposition does not typically involve prioritization. Note, "scrum" user stories is an
                            incorrectly used term.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            Agile projects are characterized by frequent changes. Inherently, these high-variability
                            environments incur more uncertainty and risk. To address this, agile practices promote
                            frequent reviews of increment work product and cross-functional project teams to accelerate
                            knowledge sharing and ensure that risk is understood and managed. Risk is considered when
                            selecting the content of each sprint, and risks are also identified, analyzed, and managed
                            during each sprint. Additionally, projects that experience a high degree of uncertainty and
                            change require active engagement and participation with project stakeholders. Agile projects
                            encourage frequent and continuous engagement with stakeholders, thus helping mitigate risk,
                            build trust, and support adjustment earlier in the project cycle, thus reducing costs and
                            increasing the likelihood of the project success. Therefore, of the choices provided,
                            engaging stakeholders frequently in the review of the product increments developed by the
                            team is the best answer to the question asked.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. The team and stakeholders should frequently review product increments.<br>
                            Correct. In agile projects, the risk is addressed in each sprint as part of backlog
                            prioritization. Once the sprint is over, the stakeholders review the product increment and
                            provide their feedback. This course of action allows the agile teams to increase review
                            frequency with appropriate stakeholders, thus resulting in early risk mitigation at a
                            minimal cost.<br>
                            B. The project stakeholders should conduct risk-based spikes in each sprint.<br>
                            Incorrect. Risk-based spikes can be conducted to address project risks. However, these
                            efforts are carried out by the project team members, rather than stakeholders. Additionally,
                            risk-based spikes performed as needed, rather than in each sprint.<br>
                            C. The product owner and the sponsor should prioritize high-risk user stories.<br>
                            Incorrect. It is true that the high-risk user stories should be properly prioritized to
                            address risk early in the project. However, this activity is performed by the product owner
                            in collaboration with the team and other relevant stakeholders (including the sponsor, if
                            needed), but not exclusively with the sponsor.<br>
                            D. The team should implement pair programming with the scrum master.<br>
                            Incorrect. Pair programming is an agile software development practice in which two team
                            members develop software code in pairs, periodically switching roles and reviewing the work
                            of each other in real-time. This practice helps reduce risks as errors are detected quickly.
                            The scrum master, however, is not involved in pair programming.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            The process of change management is fundamentally different in projects where requirements
                            are not defined upfront warranting the use of agile methodologies to develop the product.
                            With a waterfall approach, the requirements are typically defined upfront and, therefore,
                            scope changes are discouraged. For such projects, a rigorous change management process is in
                            place to ensure that change is minimized, and only the most important changes are
                            incorporated into the project. Agile takes a different approach to change management. To
                            provide the best value for the client, in projects where deliverables are produced using
                            agile practices, change is anticipated and welcomed. Instead of relying on a formal process
                            for managing change, the product owner, which is a role responsible for managing customer
                            requirements (backlog items), is much more involved in the planning of each iteration by
                            providing a prioritized backlog of features for the development team to produce. A change
                            management plan, if it is used at all, will be of little value for an agile project compared
                            with a project using a traditional waterfall approach. The scenario presents a hybrid
                            project where most of the project aspects are managed using the traditional project
                            management approach, while the development of the product is carried out using agile. Agile
                            has been selected because the requirements were not defined upfront. Therefore, of the
                            available choices, the project team will likely spend less time developing and/or
                            implementing the change management plan so that the frequent changes required by the
                            customer will be easier accommodated.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. The project charter<br>
                            Incorrect. The project charter is a document issued by the project initiator or sponsor that
                            formally authorizes the existence of a project and provides the project manager with the
                            authority to apply organizational resources to project activities. The complexity of the
                            project charter (and thus the time spent in development) is more closely related to the size
                            and importance of the project rather than the methodology that will be used. The project
                            charter is not fundamentally different in an agile project compared to a hybrid or
                            traditional waterfall project.<br>
                            B. The issue log<br>
                            Incorrect. The issue log is a project document where information about issues is recorded
                            and monitored. Issues will occur on projects regardless of the methodology that is being
                            used. It is equally important for issues to be addressed on agile projects as it is for
                            projects using a hybrid or waterfall approach. Therefore, there is not likely to be a
                            significant difference in the time spent developing and implementing the issue log.<br>
                            C. The change management plan<br>
                            Correct. The change management plan is the component of the project management plan that
                            establishes the change control board, documents the extent of its authority, and describes
                            how the change control system will be implemented. Projects in which deliverables are build
                            using agile practices do not typically use a change control board or have formal procedures
                            for processing change requests. Changes are made at the discretion of the product owner
                            rather than being controlled through a formal change management process.<br>
                            D. The Validate Scope process<br>
                            Incorrect. The Validate Scope process is the process of formalizing acceptance of the
                            completed project deliverables. The process of gaining acceptance for deliverables is
                            considerably different for pure agile projects compared with those using a waterfall
                            approach. Agile projects hold an iteration (sprint) review at the end of each iteration
                            (sprint) to demonstrate the increment of the product that was developed during the iteration
                            (sprint) and gain the approval of the product owner. A waterfall approach may only seek the
                            acceptance of deliverables at the end of the project when the product of the project is
                            complete. Therefore, a project team is more likely to spend more, not less, time performing
                            the Validate Scope process in an agile project compared with a waterfall approach.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            The scenario implies the project manager is carrying out the Develop Team process. Team
                            performance assessments are an output of that process. Ongoing team performance assessments
                            give the project manager insight into whether the team development efforts such as team
                            building, which is a tool of the Develop team process, have been effective. As initiatives
                            such as training and team building are implemented, the project manager should see
                            improvements in the team's effectiveness and cohesiveness. The correct team development
                            strategies and activities will increase the team's performance, which, in turn, increases
                            the likelihood of meeting project objectives. Therefore, in the scenario described, making a
                            team performance assessment is the next step to take and is the best way to determine if the
                            team building efforts have been productive.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Monitor the team engagement matrix<br>
                            Incorrect. The 'team engagement matrix' is a fake term made-up for this question.<br>
                            B. Develop a team charter<br>
                            Incorrect. The team charter is a document developed as part of the Plan Resource Management
                            process that establishes the team values, agreements, and operating guidelines for the team.
                            The team charter does not assess team-building activities.<br>
                            C. Conduct team performance assessments<br>
                            Correct. As initiatives such as training and team building are implemented, the project
                            manager should see improvements in the team's effectiveness. Making a team performance
                            assessment would be the best way to determine if the team building efforts, performed in
                            this scenario, have been effective.<br>
                            D. Create a responsibility assignment matrix (RAM)<br>
                            Incorrect. A RAM shows the project resources assigned to each work package. It is used to
                            illustrate the connections between work packages, or activities, and project team members.
                            The RAM does not have any utility in assessing team-building.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            Approved change requests are an output of the Perform Integrated Change Control process.
                            Once the change request has been approved, the Perform Integrated Change Control process is
                            complete, and there is nothing more that needs to be done in this process pertaining to the
                            approved change request. The approved change requests are then implemented through the
                            Direct and Manage Project Work process. In the case of a defect repair, once the repair has
                            been completed, the Control Quality process is performed to verify the repair has been
                            correctly done. In case of the modifications to the terms and conditions of the contract,
                            the change request is implemented as part of the Control Procurements process. Therefore, of
                            the available choices, the Perform Integrated Change Control process is the least likely to
                            be conducted at this point in the scenario.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Direct and Manage Project Work<br>
                            Incorrect. An approved change request may serve as an input into the Direct and Manage
                            Project Work process and implemented by the project team as part of this process. Approved
                            change requests may be a corrective action, a preventive action, or a defect repair. Thus,
                            the approved change request for defect repair should be implemented through the Direct and
                            Manage Project Work process. Therefore, the Direct and Manage Project Work process will be
                            performed in this situation, making this choice an incorrect answer.<br>
                            B. Control Quality<br>
                            Incorrect. The approved change request for defect repair will serve as an input into the
                            Control Quality process. After the defect repair has been completed, the Control Quality
                            process should be performed to confirm completeness, retest, and certify the repair.
                            Therefore, the Control Quality process should be performed in this case.<br>
                            C. Perform Integrated Change Control<br>
                            Correct. Approved change requests are an output of the Perform Integrated Change Control
                            process. Once the change request has been approved, the Perform Integrated Change Control
                            process is complete, and there is nothing more that needs to be done in this process
                            pertaining to the approved change request. Since the question is asking to select the
                            process that is least likely to be performed in this situation, this choice is the best
                            answer to the question asked.<br>
                            D. Control Procurements<br>
                            Incorrect. Approved change requests, which may serve as an input to the Control Procurements
                            process, can include modifications to the terms and conditions of a contract. The approved
                            change request to modify the agreement is then implemented through the Control Procurements
                            process. Therefore, the Control Procurements process should be conducted in this
                            scenario.<br>

                          <div class="specificfeedback">Your answer is correct.<br>
                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            The question describes a company with an organizational structure type of organic or simple.
                            In this environment, the project manager is better described as a project coordinator and
                            has little or no authority over the project. In this situation, the owner or operator
                            controls the budget and project resources. Therefore, the only viable option for you, as the
                            project manager, is to escalate the issue to the owner.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Approve overtime for the IT specialist<br>
                            Incorrect. Within an organic or simple organizational structure, the project manager does
                            not have control over the project budget. Therefore, you, as the project manager, would not
                            be able to approve the overtime for the IT specialist.<br>
                            B. Recommend project termination<br>
                            Incorrect. If the project cannot be completed or even started (as is the case in the
                            scenario described), project termination is a plausible course of action. However, the
                            selection of the correct answer should be done as part of considering all other available
                            answer choices. Another answer choice better addresses the question asked.<br>
                            C. Escalate the issue to the owner<br>
                            Correct. With an organic or simple organizational structure, the project manager has little
                            or no authority. In this situation, the owner or operator controls the budget and project
                            resources and, therefore, should be consulted for the best course of action.<br>
                            D. Install the software yourself<br>
                            Incorrect. There is not enough information in the question to determine if you have the
                            required knowledge, skills, and experience to install the software. As a project manager, or
                            coordinator (which is supposedly the case in the scenario described), you are unlikely to
                            perform technical tasks by yourself.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            The crystal family of project management methodologies falls within the larger umbrella of
                            agile methodologies. A fundamental principle of the crystal framework is the use of physical
                            colocation to enhance collaboration and benefit from osmotic communication. Osmotic
                            communication is a byproduct of physical colocation where information can flow in the
                            background, and team members can learn almost as if by osmosis. In this scenario, the
                            project will transition from an agile phase to a predictive phase with a virtual team.
                            Therefore, osmotic communication will most likely be lost in the transition, and the project
                            manager will need to utilize virtual tools to facilitate collaboration with the
                            geographically dispersed team.<br>
                            Note, it is reasonable to assume that product development and the approval process will be
                            performed by different teams. Therefore, the loss of osmotic communication does not refer to
                            the same team. The idea behind this question is to understand that osmotic communication
                            typically refers to a team that operates in a collocated environment. However, the question
                            does not ask about a specific team. Rather, it asks about the impact on the project as a
                            whole. Therefore, of the choices provided, the loss of osmotic communication is considered
                            the best answer.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. The project management approach will transition from a command and control style during
                            product development to a more collaborative environment for the approval process.<br>
                            Incorrect. Crystal is an agile methodology. Agile methodologies provide support for
                            self-organizing teams versus a more command and control approach that is typical within a
                            predictive framework. In this scenario, the project management approach will likely
                            transition from a collaborative approach to a more command and control one.<br>
                            B. Osmotic communication will be lost after the transition from product development, and
                            virtual tools will have to be utilized for team collaboration during the approval phase.<br>
                            Correct. Osmotic communication is a fundamental principle of crystal methodologies. Osmotic
                            communication is the information that flows in the background and is absorbed by the project
                            team by osmosis. Osmotic communication is a byproduct of physical colocation. Teams
                            operating in a virtual environment would not benefit from osmotic communication.<br>
                            C. The WBS will be decomposed down to the work package level for the product development
                            phase and then progressively elaborated for the regulatory approval process.<br>
                            Incorrect. With traditional waterfall projects, the work breakdown structure (WBS) is fully
                            decomposed during project planning. With agile methodologies, such as crystal, the project
                            scope will be captured at high-level and then progressively elaborated throughout the
                            project. Therefore, in this case, the project scope will transition from being progressively
                            elaborated during product development to being fully decomposed during project planning for
                            the approval phase.<br>
                            D. The change control process will be very stringent during the product development phase
                            and then reduced or entirely eliminated for the regulatory approval process.<br>
                            Incorrect. Predictive project management is characterized by stringent change control to
                            prevent scope creep. However, with agile methodologies like crystal, change is welcomed and
                            harnessed for the benefit of the customer. Therefore, in this scenario, change control will
                            transition from lightweight and informal to formal and more stringent.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            The scenario indicates that an agile framework will be used within an overarching project
                            management plan, making this a hybrid project. When incorporating an agile lifecycle, the
                            project deliverables will be produced incrementally and iteratively. By the end of each
                            iteration, the project team will have delivered a product increment that represents business
                            value. There are a variety of ways that stakeholders might be apprised of the delivery of
                            business value, and the strategy for communicating this information should be recorded in
                            the communications management plan and/or the stakeholder engagement plan when a project is
                            operated under the auspices of a project management plan. The correct answers represent
                            several strategies that might be employed to keep the key stakeholders informed of the
                            project's progress and the delivery of business value in this hybrid environment. The
                            incorrect answer choices represent anti-patterns when incorporating agile methodologies.<br>
                            Note, the word "apprise" means "inform", "notify", "tell", "advise", etc. Not to be confused
                            with "appraise". We intentionally used the word "apprise" in order to represent one of the
                            tasks of the PMP® Examination Content Outline. The task reads: "Apprise stakeholders of
                            value gain progress."<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Wait until the end of the project to demonstrate the project deliverables to the
                            stakeholders<br>
                            Incorrect. When using an agile development cycle, project deliverables will be produced and
                            delivered iteratively. Typically, at the end of each iteration, the project team will
                            demonstrate the product increment to gain acceptance. Waiting until the end of the project
                            to demonstrate project deliverables would be an anti-pattern when using agile methods and
                            would not keep the key stakeholders apprised of the business value delivered 'throughout'
                            the project as requested by the question.<br>
                            B. Invite the stakeholders to attend the regular iteration review meetings<br>
                            Correct. During an iteration review meeting, the project team will demonstrate the product
                            increment to the product owner and any relevant stakeholders. Stakeholders attending the
                            iteration review meeting will be able to see the business value delivered with each
                            iteration.<br>
                            C. Assign story points based on the business value for each item in the project backlog<br>
                            Incorrect. The project backlog should be prioritized according to business value when
                            incorporating agile methodologies. However, story points are not typically assigned based on
                            the business value of a backlog item (e.g., a user story). Story points are used to
                            relatively size the amount of effort to complete each item in the backlog.<br>
                            D. Utilize information radiators such as a Kanban board and burn charts.<br>
                            Correct. Information radiators, such as a Kanban board and burn charts, are highly visible
                            physical or digital displays that can be used to "radiate" (provide information about)
                            project status to the rest of the organization.<br>
                            E. Ensure the communications management plan specifies periodic project status reporting to
                            the stakeholders<br>
                            Correct. Project status reports can provide relevant information on the progress of the
                            project and the delivery of business value. The timing of the reporting, as well as the
                            content to be provided, should be specified in the communications management plan.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            As you are considering an opportunity to take advantage of a new tool for a project that has
                            just gotten underway, the scenario indicates you are in the Implement Risk Responses
                            process. You have five strategies to consider for dealing with specific opportunities:
                            escalate, exploit, share, enhance, and accept. Considering that your organization has just
                            acquired a new subsidiary, you should exploit opportunities to capture the benefits of
                            assimilating them into the organization. Using new technologies to reduce cost and duration
                            are a key example of exploiting an opportunity.<br>
                            When it comes to overall project risk, there is a similar set of five strategies to
                            consider: avoid, exploit, transfer/share, mitigate/enhance, and accept. Where the level of
                            overall project risk is significantly positive and outside the agreed-upon risk thresholds
                            for the project, an exploit strategy may be adopted. An example of exploiting at the overall
                            project level would include the addition of high-benefit elements of scope to the project to
                            add value or benefits to stakeholders. Alternatively, to embrace the opportunity, the risk
                            thresholds for the project may be modified if the key stakeholders are in agreement.<br>
                            Note, the risk thresholds are recorded in the risk management plan to reflect the acceptable
                            level of overall project risk exposure. Since the risk management plan is a component of the
                            project management plan, a change request is required to modify any information included in
                            the plan, such as the risk thresholds.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Do nothing, because the opportunity does not meet your existing stakeholders' risk
                            thresholds as documented in your risk management plan.<br>
                            Incorrect. Doing nothing when there is a clear opportunity from which the project can
                            benefit (even if the opportunity does not meet the existing risk thresholds) is unlikely to
                            be the best course of action and is not what a project manager is expected to do.<br>
                            B. Ask your project sponsor for permission to switch to the tool that has been used by the
                            new subsidiary in their recently completed project.<br>
                            Incorrect. A change that affects technological resources, staff skills, schedules and costs
                            would normally require more formality than just asking your sponsor for permission.<br>
                            C. Submit a change request to adjust the risk thresholds that consider the new stakeholders'
                            risk appetite and to update the baselines.<br>
                            Correct. The new subsidiary has a new set of stakeholders with different risk appetite. To
                            embrace the opportunity, the risk thresholds for the project may be modified if the key
                            stakeholders are in agreement. A change request should also address the requisite
                            adjustments to cost and schedule baselines.<br>
                            D. Train your team to use the new tool based on the expert judgment of your new subsidiary's
                            integration project team members.<br>
                            Incorrect. It makes sense to take advantage of the knowledge existing within the integration
                            team of the new subsidiary to train your team to use the new tool. However, before spending
                            project resources, you must first resolve the conflict between the opportunity and the risk
                            thresholds in your risk management plan as well as variances in cost and schedule.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            Manage Quality is the process of translating the quality management plan into executable
                            quality activities that incorporate the organization's quality policies into the project. In
                            the scenario, the team is implementing the activities specified in the quality management
                            plan. Therefore, it can be reasonably assumed that the project team is carrying out the
                            Manage Quality process. Quality is often seen as meeting the defined customer and
                            stakeholder requirements. In agile projects, stakeholder engagement with the team ensures
                            customer and stakeholder satisfaction is maintained throughout the project. Since, according
                            to the scenario, the project manager is looking for an opportunity to test out some agile
                            practices on the current project, and with the project team performing the Manage Quality
                            process, encouraging continuous stakeholder engagement with the team members is the best
                            course of action to achieve the goal set by the project manager.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Suggest that the team use alternative analysis instead of document analysis<br>
                            Incorrect. Both alternative analysis and document analysis are examples of the data analysis
                            technique that can be used as part of the Manage Quality process implied by the scenario.
                            Data analysis is typically associated with predictive projects. Also, each analysis has its
                            own merits, and replacing one by another would not make the project more agile.<br>
                            B. Encourage continuous stakeholder engagement with the team members<br>
                            Correct. One of the fundamental differences between traditional and agile projects is the
                            level of stakeholder engagement/involvement. On traditional projects, the stakeholders are
                            typically involved at key project milestones/gates. On agile projects, stakeholders are
                            continuously involved and provide their input. Therefore, encouraging stakeholder engagement
                            with the team would best meet the project manager's goal of incorporating some agile
                            practices into the current project, making this choice the best answer to the question
                            asked.<br>
                            C. Incorporate team-building activities into product testing and inspection tasks<br>
                            Incorrect. While it is possible to make work more fun by incorporating some team-building
                            activities into daily tasks, team-building activities have nothing to do with product
                            testing and inspection. Incorporating team building into quality-related tools and
                            techniques is unlikely to achieve the stated goal of experimenting with agile practices.<br>
                            D. Limit stakeholder involvement to shield the team from external distractions<br>
                            Incorrect. Shielding the team from distractions is one of the servant leader's duties and is
                            commonly practiced in agile projects. However, this practice should not be abused for the
                            sake of limiting stakeholder involvement. Quite the opposite, it is the increased
                            stakeholder engagement that makes the project more agile.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            The resource calendar is a calendar that identifies the working days and shifts upon which
                            each specific resource is available helping identify times when the project team members can
                            participate in team development activities. The resource calendars may provide information
                            on the availability of other needed resources such as a meeting room, audio/visual
                            equipment, etc. The incorrect answer choices may or may not provide some information, but
                            they do not specify resource availability. Therefore, of the available options, looking at
                            the resource calendar is the best answer to the question asked.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Look at the resource calendar<br>
                            Correct. The resource calendar is a calendar that identifies the working days and shifts
                            upon which each specific resource is available. Thus, resource calendars may help identify
                            times when the project team members can participate in team building activities.<br>
                            B. Review the project team assignments<br>
                            Incorrect. The project team assignments identify the team and member roles and
                            responsibilities. However, the project team assignments do not provide insight into the team
                            members' availability to participate in team building activities.<br>
                            C. Check with the team members<br>
                            Incorrect. While checking with the team members may address the needs of the project
                            manager, this action is unlikely to be the best use of time of the project manager and the
                            team members when the requested information is readily available in project documents.<br>
                            D. Consult the project schedule<br>
                            Incorrect. The project schedule may provide some useful information including when the
                            project team members have existing commitments for completing project activities. However,
                            the project schedule does not have the team members availability for scheduling activities
                            as well as other resources that might be used such as a meeting room.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            Obviously, failure is not the goal of any project. However, it is better for a project to
                            fail sooner rather than later. As it pertains to risk mitigation, agile teams prefer to fail
                            fast to detect and correct potential problems as early in the project life-cycle as
                            possible. By failing fast, the team will have an opportunity to learn early. Not only the
                            team, but the whole organization can benefit from the fast failure, because if the team
                            cannot eventually overcome the risks and challenges, then the organization can consider
                            project termination and reallocation of the organizational resources.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Accelerate the development speed to its maximum in the first iteration to achieve the
                            fastest velocity possible<br>
                            Incorrect. Velocity is the number of story points an agile team completes in a predefined
                            period of time, e.g., an iteration. Trying to achieve the fastest velocity is a noble goal.
                            However, this course of action would not ensure that project risks are exposed and addressed
                            early in the project, which is what the project manager is trying to accomplish.<br>
                            B. Do everything to ensure that the project is terminated as fast as possible as it was
                            doomed to fail in the first place<br>
                            Incorrect. If a project was doomed to fail, then a company should not have undertaken it in
                            the first place. Doing everything to ensure that the project is terminated as fast as
                            possible makes little to no sense.<br>
                            C. Start with the development of the features that have the biggest number of story points
                            associated with them<br>
                            Incorrect. Features that are estimated to have the biggest number of story points are not
                            necessarily the most complicated or risky work items. Therefore, developing those features
                            would not necessarily result in failure.<br>
                            D. Develop features with the greatest inherent risk to spot problems early and try to solve
                            them as soon as possible<br>
                            Correct. If risks are exposed early in the project, and the team is able to mitigate them,
                            the project has better chances to be successful. If, however, the issues associated with the
                            risks are hard or impossible to solve, knowing this sooner than later would allow the
                            organization to stop spending resources on a project that cannot proceed.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            The scenario implies you are involved in the Plan Stakeholder Engagement process. Plan
                            Stakeholder Engagement is the process of developing approaches to involve project
                            stakeholders based on their needs, expectations, interests, and potential impact on the
                            project. The stakeholder register is one of the inputs to this process. The stakeholder
                            register is typically created during project initiation. The power/interest grid can be used
                            to classify stakeholders according to their level of authority (power) and level of concern
                            about the project's outcomes (interest). According to the scenario, the project sponsor's
                            authority is low, which translates to low power; however, the sponsor's level of
                            enthusiasm/concern about the project's outcomes is high, which means the sponsor's interest
                            in the project is high. This means the project sponsor's classification will be displayed at
                            the bottom-right quadrant of the power/interest grid.<br>
                            Note, ideally, the project sponsor should have both the power and interest at their high
                            level, i.e., the project sponsor's classification should be displayed at the top-right
                            quadrant of the power/interest grid.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. A<br>
                            Incorrect. Quadrant A represents stakeholders with a high level of authority (power), but a
                            low level of concern about the project's outcomes (interest). In the scenario, the project
                            sponsor is described as a stakeholder with a low level of authority (low power) but
                            enthusiastic, i.e., having a high level of concern about the project's outcomes (high
                            interest). This classification falls into quadrant D, not A.<br>

                            C. C<br>
                            Incorrect. Quadrant C represents stakeholders with a low level of authority (power) and a
                            low level of concern about the project's outcomes (interest). In the scenario, the project
                            sponsor is described as a stakeholder with a low level of authority (low power) but
                            enthusiastic about the project's outcomes (high interest). This classification falls into
                            quadrant D, not C.<br>
                            D. D<br>
                            Correct. Quadrant D represents stakeholders with a low level of authority (power) but a high
                            level of concern about the project's outcomes (interest). In the scenario, the project
                            sponsor is described as a stakeholder with a low level of authority (low power) but
                            enthusiastic about the project's outcomes (high interest). This classification is aligned
                            with the bottom-right quadrant of the power/interest grid, making this choice the best
                            answer to the question asked.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            The scenario describes a hybrid project, in which deliverables are produced using agile
                            practices (iteratively), while the project status and progress are reported to stakeholders
                            using the predictive project management approach. To track and report the project status
                            using traditional tools and techniques while the work is undertaken via iterations, the work
                            performance data should first be collected at an iteration level. For example, team velocity
                            (development speed), actual costs, defect rates, team capacity, etc. can be measured at the
                            end of each iteration and then compiled to understand the trends in project performance.
                            These trends, in turn, can then be summed up and extrapolated to monitor and track the
                            overall project performance and estimate completion projection, making tracking project
                            performance the best answer to the question asked.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Collecting stakeholder requirements<br>
                            Incorrect. Requirements are typically collected during project planning. According to the
                            scenario, the project is in execution. While in hybrid projects, as the one described in the
                            scenario, requirements can be collected as part of iteration planning, gathering data about
                            velocity, costs, and quality would not significantly contribute to requirements
                            gathering.<br>
                            B. Tracking project performance<br>
                            Correct. It makes sense that collecting data at an iteration level about the speed at which
                            the deliverables are produced (velocity), actual costs spent by the team, quality of the
                            deliverables, and then summing up these trends and extrapolating them at a project level is
                            done to monitor, track, and estimate the overall performance of the project.<br>
                            C. Controlling the quality of deliverables<br>
                            Incorrect. It is possible that the data collected (velocity, costs, quality) can provide an
                            insight into the quality of deliverables. However, quality is only one aspect of the data
                            collected by the project manager in the scenario described. Another answer choice more
                            accurately addresses the question asked.<br>
                            D. Documenting lessons learned<br>
                            Incorrect. Lessons learned can be documented at any point in the project life cycle.
                            However, the activity carried out by the project manager in the scenario provided is closer
                            associated with tracking project performance rather than capturing lessons learned.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            While the scenario may sound a bit unrealistic with the project sponsor getting into
                            technical details of the sprint backlog, the idea behind this question is to introduce the
                            concept of reciprocal commitment. Reciprocal commitment refers to an agile development team
                            who commits to delivering 100% of the specified functionality according to the definition of
                            done at the end of the sprint, and the product owner, the organization, the stakeholders,
                            and the customer who agrees not to add new scope/user stories or change priorities during
                            the sprint. Although reciprocal commitment is an important agile principle, it is by no
                            means absolute. The product owner is ultimately accountable for the sprint backlog and what
                            should be included in the current sprint. Therefore, the best course of action for the
                            project manager to take is to contact the product owner and ask if the user stories are
                            still a priority. The product owner may do one of the following, for example:<br>
                            Replace the user stories with other user stories in the current sprint backlog. This should
                            be done in coordination with the development team;<br>
                            Apply even higher priority to any user stories affected by this technology in order to get
                            as much value from the market as possible before the new technology is released;<br>
                            Cancel the current sprint and start a new sprint with a re-prioritized set of user stories.
                            This is an extreme, but possible scenario.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Remove the user stories indicated by the sponsor from the sprint backlog<br>
                            Incorrect. Although the input of the sponsor is very valuable, the responsibility of the
                            product backlog lies with the product owner, not the sponsor or project manager. Removing
                            the user stories from the backlog would be overstepping the authority the project manager
                            has on an agile project.<br>
                            B. Ignore the sponsor's input and instruct the team to proceed as originally planned<br>
                            Incorrect. The team does have a commitment to complete the user stories to achieve the
                            originally established sprint goals. However, agile teams have to be adaptive to change,
                            especially when the change might affect their work. Ignoring the sponsor's input does not
                            sound like the best course of action.<br>
                            C. Contact the product owner and ask if the user stories are still a priority<br>
                            Correct. The product owner is ultimately responsible for the direction of the product. The
                            product owner, in collaboration with the team, establishes the sprint backlog and determines
                            the priority of its user stories. Therefore, of the choices provided, contacting the product
                            owner and asking if the user stories are still a priority is the best course of action.<br>
                            D. Conduct market research to confirm the announcement of the new technology<br>
                            Incorrect. Conducting market research to confirm the announcement of the new technology
                            seems as if the project manager does not trust the information provided by the sponsor.
                            Additionally, conducting the research may take time, and the results might be too late for
                            the current sprint, making this choice a doubtful answer.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            When incorporating agile methodologies into a predictive model, the project team members are
                            empowered to make many of the decisions typically made by the project manager in a purely
                            predictive environment. When conducting a sprint (iteration) planning meeting, the Scrum
                            team is empowered to breakdown the user stories into low-level tasks, estimate the time
                            required for completion, and determine how much work can be completed during the sprint
                            based on their capacity. The project team is in the best position to understand the amount
                            of time required to complete the tasks as well as their capabilities and capacity.
                            Additionally, if the objectives of the sprint are forced upon the Scrum team, the team is
                            less likely to have the same level of commitment as if they set their own sprint goal.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Asked the team to prioritize the product backlog before determining the sprint
                            backlog<br>
                            Incorrect. The members of the Scrum team might provide inputs regarding the priorities of
                            various user stories in the product backlog and sprint backlog. However, backlog
                            prioritization is the ultimate responsibility of the product owner.<br>
                            B. Assigned the identified low-level tasks to specific individuals in the project
                            schedule<br>
                            Incorrect. When using a traditional approach, the project manager might assign tasks to
                            specific individuals in the project schedule. However, when incorporating Scrum into a
                            predictive model, as is implied in the scenario, the Scrum team determines who will complete
                            specific tasks as well as the amount of work that can be completed during a sprint.<br>
                            C. Empowered the team to determine how many user stories they can complete during the
                            sprint<br>
                            Correct. The scenario suggests a hybrid project management approach is used in the project
                            by incorporating Scrum into a predictive model. In Scrum, the team is empowered to determine
                            how many user stories they can complete during a sprint.<br>
                            D. Used story points instead of hours while estimating the size of the user stories and
                            tasks<br>
                            Incorrect. Teams can use any unit of measure to express their capacity. All that is required
                            is that the entire team has a consistent and common understanding of how their capacity is
                            measured throughout the project. Story points and hours are both common methods for relative
                            sizing and expressing capacity and would not have any bearing on the success or failure in
                            achieving a sprint goal.<br>

                          <div class="specificfeedback">Your answer is incorrect.<br><br>Explanation: A story map is a
                            high-level planning tool that is used by agile project stakeholders to map out the project
                            features and their priorities in the early planning stages of the project. The main
                            difference between the story map and the roadmap is that the product roadmap organizes the
                            features placed on the story map in releases, which allows the stakeholders to see what
                            features will be delivered in each release. A user story map does not have information about
                            releases and milestones. It is a useful way to discuss the features. Think of a story map as
                            a visual representation of the product backlog, which can be used as an input to release
                            planning. The incorrect answer choices are not visual tools described in the question. User
                            story mapping involves ordering user stories along two independent dimensions. The "map"
                            arranges user activities along the horizontal axis in rough order of priority. Down the
                            vertical axis, the map represents the increasing sophistication of the implementation. Given
                            a story map so arranged, the first horizontal row represents a "walking skeleton", a
                            barebones but usable version of the product. Working through successive rows fleshes out the
                            product with additional functionality. As an example, the backbone would be at the very top
                            of the story map, and the walking skeleton would be the sequence of stories underneath
                            it.<br><img

                              alt="." width="800" height="750"><br><br>Details for Each Option:&nbsp;<br>A. User story
                            mapping Correct. User story mapping is a visual practice for organizing work into a useful
                            model to help understand the sets of high-value features to be created over time, identify
                            omissions in the backlog, and effectively plan releases that deliver value to users. This
                            choice most accurately describes the scenario provided and is, therefore, the best answer to
                            the question asked.<br>B. Product backlog Incorrect. A product backlog is not a tool. It's
                            an ordered list of user-centric requirements that a team maintains for a product. Besides,
                            one of the capabilities the meeting participants are looking in the tool is its ability to
                            identify omissions in the backlog. Using a backlog to identify omissions in the backlog does
                            not make sense.<br>C. Work breakdown structure Incorrect. The work breakdown structure (WBS)
                            is a hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work to be carried out by the project
                            team to accomplish the project objectives and create the required deliverables. The WBS does
                            not have the virtues that the meeting participants are looking for.<br>D. Kanban board
                            Incorrect. A kanban board is a visualization tool that is typically used by agile teams to
                            help them manage their workflow. The board displays work items/tasks organized in their
                            various states. This tool does not help understand the sets of high-value features to be
                            created over time, identifying omissions in the backlog and planning
                            releases.<br><br>Reference: Agile Practice Guide - First Edition, Project Management

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            The scenario covers two project management processes, Manage Stakeholder Engagement, and
                            Monitor Stakeholder Engagement. The former is focused on communicating and working with
                            stakeholders to meet their needs and expectations, address issues, and foster appropriate
                            stakeholder involvement. The latter is concerned with monitoring stakeholder relationships
                            and tailoring strategies for engaging stakeholders through modification of engagement
                            strategies and plans. According to the scenario, the executive stakeholders are disengaged.
                            Therefore, the project manager should work with them to determine what has to be done to
                            improve the level of their engagement, which, hopefully, would contribute to their support
                            for the project and eventually increase the chances of project success.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Do nothing as executives are superior to project managers<br>
                            Incorrect. According to the scenario, the executives are project stakeholders. Keeping
                            stakeholders, especially executives, engaged would allow the project manager to increase
                            their support for the project, thus improving the chances of project success. Doing nothing,
                            on the other hand, would decrease those chances.<br>
                            B. Escalate the issue to the project sponsor<br>
                            Incorrect. Escalating the issue to the project sponsor is a premature action. The project
                            manager should first work directly with the executive stakeholders to identify the issues
                            causing the lack of engagement and then attempt to address those issues. If all reasonable
                            efforts fail, and the lack of stakeholder engagement is negatively affecting the project,
                            then the project manager should seek assistance from the project sponsor.<br>
                            C. Work with the executives to improve their engagement<br>
                            Correct. The project manager needs to collaborate with the executive stakeholders to address
                            the gap in the level of their engagement.<br>
                            D. Update the stakeholder register<br>
                            Incorrect. It is true that the stakeholder register will need to be updated to reflect the
                            current level of the stakeholder engagement. However, the question is asking about the
                            'best' (not 'first') course of action. In other words, the question is looking for the
                            answer choice that represents an action aiming to resolve the problem described in the
                            question, which is the insufficient level of stakeholder engagement. Simply updating
                            stakeholder register would not resolve the problem.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            The question suggests that the project manager is performing the Manage Stakeholder
                            Engagement process and needs to resolve an issue for a stakeholder to retain their support.
                            Negotiation is one of the tools and techniques which may be useful during the Manage
                            Stakeholder Engagement process. It is best to negotiate a reasonable solution to the problem
                            described in the question to retain the stakeholder's support for the project. Since the
                            change request to replace all of the barcode scanners was denied, there is no point in
                            resubmitting the same request. However, just replacing the broken scanners seems like a
                            reasonable solution that might be best for the stakeholder and the project. The change
                            control board (CCB) might approve replacing the broken scanners even if they denied
                            replacing all of the scanners previously. Therefore, of the available choices, the best
                            course of action is to offer to assist the stakeholder by submitting a change request to
                            replace only the broken scanners.<br>
                            Note that the concern raised by the key stakeholder should be captured in the issue log as
                            well. However, updating the issue log was not listed as an answer choice. On the real exam,
                            the PMP aspirant will likely encounter situations where the obvious answer is not listed as
                            an option, and the 'best' answer must be selected from the available choices.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Offering to assist the stakeholder by submitting a change request to replace only the
                            broken scanners<br>
                            Correct. This answer choice represents the interpersonal and team skill of negotiation. It
                            is best to negotiate a reasonable solution to the concern raised by the stakeholder to
                            retain their support for the project.<br>
                            B. Explaining that the project budget does not include funds for the replacement of the
                            scanners<br>
                            Incorrect. While the question describes a project with a tight budget, the scenario does not
                            provide the reason for the rejection of the change request. If it did, explaining the
                            rationale for the denial may be necessary. However, it does not resolve the stakeholder's
                            concern.<br>
                            C. Referring the stakeholder to the project sponsor since the issue is beyond the authority
                            of the project manager<br>
                            Incorrect. Issues beyond the authority of the project manager will likely be addressed by
                            the project sponsor. However, the project sponsor should only be involved when other
                            alternatives that are under the control of the project manager have been exploited. There is
                            another answer choice that describes a plausible option without the need of escalating to
                            the project sponsor.<br>
                            D. Promising the key stakeholder that the replacement of the scanners will be included in
                            the next project<br>
                            Incorrect. The project manager may not be able to keep this commitment. The replacement of
                            scanners may or may not be relevant to the next project. More importantly, the project
                            manager does not secure funding or approve project management plans and baselines for
                            projects. The project manager is not likely to have the authority to ensure the replacement
                            scanners can be included in the scope of the next project.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            The scenario implies the business is concerned with the processes of the Project Procurement
                            Management Knowledge Area. The challenge in the scenario described is that some of the
                            contracted items that the business is planning to outsource to a vendor are fixed while
                            others are subject to change. Under these circumstances, applying a hybrid project
                            management approach for the contracting work may be the best course of action. In this case,
                            rather than formalizing an entire contracting relationship in a single document, parties to
                            an agreement can achieve more flexibility by describing different aspects in different
                            documents. Mostly fixed items, such as warranties and arbitrations, can be locked in a
                            master agreement, as described in the scenario, while items that are subject to change, such
                            as services rates and product descriptions, can be documented in a schedule of services,
                            making the schedule of services the best answer to the question asked.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Work breakdown structure<br>
                            Incorrect. The work breakdown structure (WBS) is a hierarchical decomposition of the total
                            scope of work to be carried out by the project team to accomplish the project objectives and
                            create the required deliverables. The WBS is not used to secure contractual relationships
                            between a buyer and a seller.<br>
                            B. Change control board<br>
                            Incorrect. The change control board (CCB) is a formally chartered group responsible for
                            reviewing and deciding on changes on a project. While changes related to the contracted work
                            between a buyer and a seller may go via the CCB, the CCB is a group and not a project
                            artifact that is used to secure contractual relationships between the parties.<br>
                            C. Cost-reimbursable contract<br>
                            Incorrect. The cost-reimbursable contract is a type of contract that involves payments to
                            the seller (vendor) for the seller's actual costs, plus a fee that represents the seller's
                            profit. While this type of contract can be used in the scenario described, the essence of
                            the question lies with how to contractually document the work items that are subject to
                            change rather than to address the way the seller is compensated.<br>
                            D. Schedule of services<br>
                            Correct. The schedule of services is a document that describes outsourced work items that
                            are subject to change, such as services rates and product descriptions, as presented in the
                            scenario. This document may supplement a master service agreement (MSA) used to secure the
                            fixed work items. This approach, addressing fixed and subject-to-change items, is typical
                            for hybrid procurement methods.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            The way the scenario is framed implies that the project manager does not understand the
                            basic principles behind agile estimation and planning. A story point is the typical unit of
                            measure to estimate work items in the product backlog. The most important aspect to
                            understand here is the relativity of the story point. The story point is a unit-less measure
                            used in relative user story estimation techniques. Each team will have its own understanding
                            of the size of the story point. Therefore, comparing story point estimates provided by two
                            different teams would make no sense. The team's capacity (velocity) is measured in story
                            points. Capacity is the number of story points that a team completes in a predefined period
                            of time, e.g., an iteration. Since each agile team interprets the size of the story point
                            differently, each team would have its own capacity. This concept of each agile team having
                            its won capacity is what the project manager most likely does not understand in the scenario
                            provided.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Estimates in story points always look high.<br>
                            Incorrect. Answer choices with absolute statements, such as "always", "never", etc.
                            typically represent incorrect answers. Saying that estimates expressed in story points
                            'always' look high would be inaccurate, to say the least.<br>
                            B. Each agile team has its own capacity.<br>
                            Correct. A story point is a relative unit of measure. Each agile team would likely have its
                            own understanding of how much work is involved in completing one story point. Hence, each
                            agile team will have its own capacity (velocity) and, therefore, cannot be compared with
                            another team, regardless of how similar the projects the teams are working on may look
                            like.<br>
                            C. The team is using padding to secure its estimates.<br>
                            Incorrect. It is possible that the team is using padding to secure its estimates. However,
                            comparing estimates provided by two different agile teams is a flawed approach since the
                            size of a story point differs from one team to another, thus, implying that the capacity of
                            one team would differ from the capacity of another team.<br>
                            D. The two projects are not similar.<br>
                            Incorrect. There is not enough information in the scenario to determine if the projects are
                            similar. However, this information is irrelevant. The point that the project manager is
                            missing is that comparing the estimates provided by two different agile teams would not
                            provide reliable results since each team is different, the size of a story point used by
                            each team is different, and so the capacity (velocity) of each team would differ from one
                            another.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            Plan Quality Management is the process of identifying quality requirements and standards for
                            the project and its deliverables which is what is described in the scenario provided. The
                            project charter and components of the project management plan are inputs to the Plan Quality
                            Management process, which have already been reviewed as per the scenario. Project documents
                            including the requirements documentation are also inputs to the Plan Quality Management
                            process. Project management best practices include gathering all relevant information in the
                            form of inputs before applying the tools and techniques to produce the outputs. Therefore,
                            of the available options, to begin the Plan Quality Management process, reviewing the
                            requirements documentation is the next logical step for the project manager to take.<br>
                            Note, requirements documentation is not a component of the project management plan. Rather,
                            requirements documentation is considered a project document. Therefore, this part of the
                            question text, "The project manager has reviewed... relevant information from the available
                            components of the project management plan." refers only to the components of the project
                            management plan, not the project documents, implying requirements documentation has not yet
                            been reviewed.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Review the requirements documentation to gain an understanding of the project and product
                            quality requirements<br>
                            Correct. The question suggests that the Plan Quality Management process is about to begin.
                            Project documents including the requirements documentation are inputs to this process.<br>
                            B. Conduct a brainstorming session with the project team and subject matter experts to
                            develop the quality management plan<br>
                            Incorrect. A brainstorming session is one of the tools and techniques of the Plan Quality
                            Management process implied by the scenario. However, before a brainstorming session can
                            begin, the actions related to collecting the process inputs should be completed. Then,
                            information gained from the inputs will likely be used during the brainstorming session.<br>
                            C. Perform a cost-benefit analysis to determine if the planned quality activities are
                            cost-effective<br>
                            Incorrect. One of the tools and techniques used during the Plan Quality Management process
                            suggested by the scenario is a cost-benefit analysis. A cost-benefit analysis is used to
                            determine if the planned quality activities are cost-effective. The question indicates that
                            a review of project documents that serve as inputs into this process have yet to be
                            completed. Hence, quality activities have yet to be planned, and, therefore, a cost-benefit
                            analysis would not be possible.<br>
                            D. Update the lessons learned register with information on challenges encountered in the
                            quality planning process<br>
                            Incorrect. The question implies that the Plan Quality Management process is underway, and
                            the project manager is still gathering the inputs for this process. It is unlikely that any
                            lessons learned have been gained at this point in the process. Additionally, updating
                            project documents including the lessons learned register are outputs of the Plan Quality
                            Management process, while the question is looking for an additional input.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            The question suggests that you, as the project manager, are performing the Acquire Resources
                            process by obtaining the project team members. The lessons learned register is one of the
                            project documents that may be updated as a result of this process. The lessons learned
                            register should be updated with information on challenges encountered and how they could
                            have been avoided as well as approaches that worked well for acquiring resources. The
                            incorrect answer choices represent actions that are not relevant since the developer is
                            already committed to a different project. At this point, the best course of action is to
                            record the information in the lessons learned register so the knowledge gained can improve
                            future performance. Therefore, of the available choices, adding a recommendation in the
                            lessons learned register to use pre-assignment for future projects is your best course of
                            action.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Update the project charter to list the developer as pre-assigned to your project<br>
                            Incorrect. Using pre-assignment during the Develop Project Charter process may have
                            prevented the problem described by the question. However, with the developer already
                            committed to a different project, it is too late to pre-assign the developer to your
                            project.<br>
                            B. Set up the project team as a virtual team to allow the developer to work on your project
                            part-time<br>
                            Incorrect. A virtual team setup can create new possibilities when acquiring project team
                            members, such as enabling the geographically diverse individuals to serve on the same
                            project team. However, in this scenario, the developer is already committed to a different
                            project. Therefore, setting up the team in a virtual configuration would not 'reserve' the
                            developer for your project. Additionally, there is not enough information in the question to
                            determine if the needs of another project would allow the developer to work on your project
                            part-time.<br>
                            C. Add a recommendation in the lessons learned register to use pre-assignment as needed for
                            future projects<br>
                            Correct. The lessons learned register can be updated with information on challenges
                            encountered and how they could have been avoided. With the developer already committed to
                            another project, the best course of action is to record the information in the lessons
                            learned register so the knowledge gained can improve future performance.<br>
                            D. Include the developer's role and responsibilities in the project team assignments for
                            your project<br>
                            Incorrect. Project team assignments is a project document that provides information on the
                            team members and their roles and responsibilities for the project. This document is an
                            output of the Acquire Resources process described in the scenario and should include only
                            those team members who have been acquired as part of this process. The developer has not
                            been acquired.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            When a project requires the cooperation of various organizations, teams, departments, etc.,
                            it's best when all parties use the same project management practices. However, in reality,
                            this is not always possible. In the scenario described, the internal project team is
                            comprised of generalizing specialists who suggest to carry out the work iteratively, i.e.,
                            using agile practices. However, the vendor refuses. There is not enough information in the
                            scenario to determine if the organization can force the vendor to adopt agile methods for
                            the duration of the project. The team, being a self-organizing unit, is empowered to make
                            decisions related to its work and, therefore, decides that at least their portion of the
                            project work will be carried out using agile. When two different project management
                            approaches are combined (either voluntarily or out of necessity), the best approach to take
                            in this situation is to manage the project as a hybrid.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Hybrid<br>
                            Correct. A self-organizing team comprised of generalizing specialists is a characteristic of
                            an agile project management approach. Since the vendor refuses to cooperate, and only
                            software will be developed iteratively, taking a hybrid project management approach is the
                            only available choice in the circumstances described.<br>
                            B. Waterfall<br>
                            Incorrect. In the waterfall project management approach (also known as predictive or
                            traditional) the requirements are typically well-known upfront, the plans are developed
                            early in the project life cycle, the work is executed according to the plan, and the project
                            is closed after the deliverables are produced, tested, and accepted. In the scenario,
                            however, at least the software portion of the product will be developed iteratively,
                            implying the overall project management approach is not a waterfall.<br>
                            C. Agile<br>
                            Incorrect. An agile project management approach advocates for iterative and/or incremental
                            product development. However, since the vendor refuses to cooperate with the team to work in
                            an iterative manner, the overall project management approach cannot be agile.<br>
                            D. Predictive<br>
                            Incorrect. A predictive project management approach is also known as waterfall or
                            traditional. When such an approach is taken on a project, it is likely that the requirements
                            are well-known upfront, the plans are developed early in the project life cycle, the work is
                            executed according to the plan, and the project is closed after the deliverables are
                            produced, tested, and accepted. In the scenario, however, at least the software portion of
                            the product will be developed iteratively, implying the overall project management approach
                            is not predictive.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            Ideally, agile teams are colocated. When the team is collocated, the use of a physical board
                            can be very effective, as agile promotes high-touch/low-tech tools. In a virtual
                            environment, however, the use of low-tech tools, such as a physical board, post-it notes,
                            etc., might be challenging and/or ineffective. However, agile teams are self-organizing,
                            self-managing, self-directing, and empowered to make decisions related to their work. Using
                            an electronic or physical board falls under the category in which the team members have an
                            ultimate say. If they feel a physical board best meets their communication needs, no one
                            should object to this practice. Anyone can make a suggestion, but it will remain up to the
                            team how to communicate with one another. Agile teams are free to choose the method that
                            works best for them, without any interference from either internal or external
                            stakeholders.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Do nothing, as it is up to the team to decide which method or tool to use<br>
                            Correct. Agile teams are self-organizing, self-directing, and are empowered to make
                            decisions about their own work, including the tools of their preference. Therefore, doing
                            nothing is the best course of action for the project manager in the scenario described.<br>
                            B. Direct the team to use an electronic communication tool since the team is distributed<br>
                            Incorrect. While an electronic communication tool can be useful and maybe even more
                            effective for distributed teams, it is up to the team to decide what tools to use. If the
                            team members realize another tool would best meet their needs (for example, as a result of
                            conducting a retrospective meeting), the team may opt to switch to another tool.<br>
                            C. Meet with the product owner and decide on the best course of action<br>
                            Incorrect. A product owner is responsible for maximizing the value of the product and
                            accountable for the end product that is built. While the product owner may provide a
                            recommendation, the product owner is not responsible for the processes and tools used by the
                            development team.<br>
                            D. Update the risk register with the new risk that the project progress might be
                            miscommunicated<br>
                            Incorrect. There is not enough information in the scenario to determine that the
                            communication method used by the team members to share the project's progress is flawed.
                            Assuming that this method might cause miscommunication is unsubstantiated at this point.
                            Additionally, unless the project is hybrid, a risk register is unlikely to be used.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            You are requested by the project sponsor to complete the development of the project charter
                            and to lead the project. This implies you have been assigned as a project manager (even
                            though the project charter has not yet been approved). Since you have been assigned to the
                            project, it has been determined that the project will contribute to the company's business
                            goals. The next step would be chartering the project. The project charter is the document
                            that formally authorizes the project manager to apply organizational resources to project
                            activities and is an essential document for project success. Gathering data from
                            stakeholders to obtain information on high-level requirements, assumptions, constraints,
                            approval criteria, and other information is one of the techniques used when developing the
                            project charter and therefore, the next thing you should do.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Gather information from stakeholders to document high-level details on the project<br>
                            Correct. A document with high-level details on the project would be the project charter. The
                            project charter is the document that formally authorizes the project and provides the
                            project manager with the authority to apply organizational resources to project activities.
                            Gathering information from stakeholders is one of the techniques used to develop the project
                            charter and is, therefore, what you should do next.<br>
                            B. Determine whether the expected outcomes of the project justify the required
                            investment<br>
                            Incorrect. The business case describes the necessary information to determine whether the
                            expected outcomes of the project justify the required investment. The business case is
                            developed before the project and commonly used as an input to create the project charter.
                            Since you have already been assigned to the project, it is reasonable to assume that the
                            business case would have been already completed. Therefore, this choice is not the best
                            answer to the question asked.<br>
                            C. Create a document that describes how the project will be executed, monitored, controlled,
                            and closed<br>
                            Incorrect. A document that describes how the project will be executed, monitored,
                            controlled, and closed is the project management plan. This plan is developed during project
                            planning, while according to the scenario, the project is in initiation.<br>
                            D. Develop a document that describes how and when the benefits of the project will be
                            delivered<br>
                            Incorrect. The benefits management plan is the document that describes how and when the
                            benefits of the project will be delivered. The benefits management plan is developed early
                            in the project life cycle and is one of the business documents commonly used to create the
                            project charter. You have been assigned as a project manager, therefore, one may assume the
                            benefits management plan has already been completed, making this choice an incorrect
                            answer.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            Resource calendars is a project document that provides information about the time periods
                            that each resource needed for the project is available for the project. This document is
                            typically used as an input to the Acquire Resources process. Even though based on the
                            scenario, it is likely that the project has already passed the point of resource
                            acquisition, resources calendars can serve as a reference at any given time in the project
                            to check resource availability. Therefore, among the available answer choices, checking the
                            resource calendar for the availability of the testing lab and team members is what the
                            project manager should do first.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Review the resource requirements document for resource availability<br>
                            Incorrect. The resource requirements document contains the types and quantities of resources
                            required for each activity in a work package but does not provide insight into the
                            availability of those resources.<br>
                            B. Ask the project sponsor for additional resources<br>
                            Incorrect. It is not known from the information provided by the question if additional
                            resources are needed. The project manager should first check and see if the existing
                            resources are available.<br>
                            C. Check resource availability in the resource calendar<br>
                            Correct. Resource calendars document the time periods that each resource needed for the
                            project is available for the project. Checking the resource calendar for the availability of
                            the testing lab and design engineers is what the project manager should do first among the
                            available answer choices.<br>
                            D. Submit a change request to update the schedule baseline<br>
                            Incorrect. There is no information from the question that indicates a change request is
                            necessary. It is possible that a risk response already exists to address this issue without
                            delaying the project timeline. Lacking further information from the question, submitting a
                            change request is a premature action.<br>

                          <div class="specificfeedback">Your answer is incorrect.<br>
                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            The question indicates that the quality standards of the project deliverable must be updated
                            to meet new regulatory requirements. Quality standards are a component of the quality
                            management plan. The quality management plan is a component of the project management plan.
                            If changes that impact any of the components of the project management plan occur during
                            project execution, the project manager should submit a change request and follow the Perform
                            Integrated Change Control process.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Update the quality management plan due to the legal requirement<br>
                            Incorrect. A change request should be submitted before updating the project management plan.
                            Since the quality management plan is a subsidiary of the project management plan, a change
                            request should be submitted first. Therefore, this answer choice can be eliminated.<br>
                            B. Submit a change request to update the quality management plan<br>
                            Correct. Quality standards are a component of the quality management plan. The quality
                            management plan is a component of the project management plan. An update to the project
                            management plan should be preceded by the submission of a change request followed by the
                            execution of the Perform Integrated Change Control process.<br>
                            C. Ask the project sponsor to update the project charter<br>
                            Incorrect. The project sponsor may need to be informed of significant changes in the
                            project. However, the project manager is responsible for managing the project and
                            implementing any required changes. Also, the project charter is not typically updated or
                            amended with this type of changes. Therefore, this response is not the best answer
                            choice.<br>
                            D. Update the scope baseline to reflect the changes<br>
                            Incorrect. A change request must first be submitted before any baseline can be changed.
                            Therefore, updating the scope baseline should not be the next action for the project manager
                            to take.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            Knowledge is split into two forms, explicit and tacit. Explicit knowledge is easily
                            documented, such as lessons learned, while tacit knowledge is difficult to express, such as
                            experience, beliefs, or insights. Sharing tacit knowledge is difficult because it resides in
                            the minds of people who typically cannot be forced to share what they know. Allowing for
                            informal interaction, or networking, among team members and stakeholders can build an
                            atmosphere of trust thereby motivating people to share their tacit knowledge. Networking is
                            one of the tools and techniques of the Manage Project Knowledge process implied by the
                            scenario and, based on the scenario described, is the best tool for you to use to achieve
                            your goal.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>

                            an example of the data representation technique that is typically used as part of the Plan
                            Quality Management process and the Manage Quality process, while the scenario suggests you
                            are in the Manage Project Knowledge process.<br>
                            B. Networking<br>
                            Correct. Knowledge is best shared using a combination of reviewing documentation and
                            providing opportunities to interact with those who have previous experience. Networking
                            allows natural connections among team members and stakeholders creating conditions for them
                            to share and learn from each other.<br>
                            C. Brainstorming<br>
                            Incorrect. Brainstorming is a facilitated session used to generate a lot of ideas in a short
                            period. You are seeking for a way to share knowledge among the team and stakeholders.
                            Brainstorming sessions may only partially address this need.<br>
                            D. Document analysis<br>
                            Incorrect. Document analysis consists of reviewing documented information. This technique
                            can be applied individually or in groups but is unlikely to make a significant contribution
                            to knowledge sharing among the team and stakeholders.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            This contract type has various names, such as fixed-price increments, fixed-price
                            microdeliverables, fixed-price functions, fixed-priced story points, fixed-priced user
                            stories, etc. The idea behind such a contract is to fix the price per a deliverable unit. A
                            deliverable unit should be defined between the buyer and seller and can represent a
                            function, story point, micro-deliverable, user story, etc. This type of contract is useful
                            when the scope of the work is likely to change frequently, like in the scenario described.
                            In the fixed-price microdeliverables contract type, the buyer and seller agree on a specific
                            price to be paid for each unit delivered. Thus, regardless of the changes in scope, a fair
                            and contracted fee can be determined and paid to the seller.<br>
                            One may argue that since the seller will be required to develop the application using agile
                            methods, and since the Agile Manifesto values customer collaboration over contract
                            negotiation, no contracts will be required. However, the way the scenario is worded, "As
                            part of the Conduct Procurements process...", suggests that the project has both elements,
                            predictive and agile, making the whole project hybrid and warranting to have a contract in
                            place.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Fixed price, fixed scope<br>
                            Incorrect. Fixed-price, fixed-scope contracts make sense when the requirements are stable,
                            which is not the case described in the scenario.<br>
                            B. Fixed-price microdeliverables<br>
                            Correct. Fixed-price microdeliverables is a contract in which the scope can be decomposed
                            into small independent increments, such as user stories. Each user story is estimated in
                            story points and represents a working product functionality. The buyer and the seller agree
                            on a deliverable unit, such as a story point. Once a user story is delivered, its price is
                            determined based on the amount of the story points contained in the user story, so that the
                            buyer pays the seller for only those story points delivered.<br>
                            C. Not-to-exceed with fixed-fee<br>
                            Incorrect. 'Not to exceed' means that a ceiling is imposed on the total amount paid to the
                            seller, which protects the buyer in case the work goes slower than expected. 'Fixed fee'
                            means that the seller is guaranteed a certain profit margin over their materials and
                            subcontractors’ fees. The main reason for this choice to be an incorrect answer is that the
                            not-to-exceed with fixed-fee contract presupposes stable requirements, which is not the case
                            in the scenario described.<br>
                            D. Fixed price with economic adjustments<br>
                            Incorrect. A fixed price with economic adjustments contract is typically used when the
                            seller should deliver over a considerable period of years. Nothing in the scenario suggests
                            the project will be completed over an extended period of time where the costs of materials
                            are likely to change, warranting a contract with economic adjustments. Regardless, any
                            fixed-price contract is not ideal for a project where the scope is expected to change
                            weekly.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            It can be implied that the junior project manager is performing the Plan Schedule Management
                            process which will result in the schedule management plan. The scenario also describes
                            rolling wave planning as one of the tools that you, as a senior project manager, typically
                            use on projects with many unknowns. However, this question is not asking for a scheduling
                            methodology. The junior project manager has approached you, a senior project manager, for
                            help in planning her project. In other words, she is looking for your expertise or expert
                            judgment. This question is an example of a scenario that has some extraneous information
                            which may purposefully or not mislead prospective PMP aspirants. Always read the full
                            question.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Rolling wave planning<br>
                            Incorrect. Rolling wave planning is a scheduling technique where the schedule in the near
                            term is planned in detail, while the schedule in the future is planned to a higher level
                            first and then detailed as the project progresses. However, this question is not asking for
                            a scheduling technique. The junior project manager has approached you, a senior project
                            manager, for help in planning her project.<br>
                            B. Expert judgment<br>
                            Correct. Expert judgment is one of the tools and techniques that can be used as part of the
                            Plan Schedule Management process described in the scenario. The junior project manager
                            asking for advice from the senior project manager is an example of expert judgment.<br>
                            C. On-demand scheduling<br>
                            Incorrect. On-demand scheduling is an approach which is typically used on projects where the
                            workflow is managed in a Kanban system. There is not enough information in the scenario to
                            determine if Kanban system is used on the project. Additionally, the essence of the question
                            surrounds the way the junior project manager approaches schedule planning rather than a
                            specific scheduling methodology.<br>
                            D. Iterative scheduling<br>
                            Incorrect. Iterative scheduling is a form of rolling wave planning based on adaptive project
                            life cycles. However, the question is not asking for a scheduling method. The question asks
                            for the tool used by the junior project manager when she approaches the senior project
                            manager.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            The question and the correct answer link two of the Agile Manifesto values with one of the
                            Agile Manifesto principles. Welcoming changing requirements, even late in development, is
                            one of the Agile Manifesto principles. Valuing customer collaboration and responding to
                            change are among the Agile Manifesto values. Without collaboration with the customer, it is
                            unlikely that changes will be welcomed. Conversely, by welcoming changing requirements, even
                            late in development, agile teams foster collaboration among the project stakeholders.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Negotiating with the customer to formulate comprehensive project agreements<br>
                            Incorrect. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation is one of the Agile Manifesto
                            values. This choice describes the opposite of the value and, therefore, is not the best
                            answer to the question asked.<br>
                            B. Assigning work to the team members based on their motivation and trust them to get the
                            job done<br>
                            Incorrect. This answer choice refers to the agile principle that encourages to build
                            projects around motivated individuals and trust them to get the job done. However, this
                            approach does not necessarily foster collaboration between the customer and the team.
                            Motivated individuals who are trusted may get the job done by working in isolation or in a
                            silo.<br>
                            C. Ensuring that the customer and the team can maintain a constant pace indefinitely<br>
                            Incorrect. Maintaining a constant pace indefinitely is one of the Agile Manifesto
                            principles. This principle is aimed to promote sustainable development. However, this
                            principle has little or nothing to do with collaboration. Maintaining a constant pace
                            indefinitely is mainly intended to help individuals involved in the project maintain their
                            work-life balance.<br>
                            D. Welcoming changing customer requirements, even late in the development of the product<br>
                            Correct. Welcoming changing customer requirements, even late in the development of the
                            product, fosters (and requires) collaboration between the project team and the customer.
                            Therefore, this option is the best among the answer choices given.<br>

                          <div class="specificfeedback">Your answer is incorrect.<br>
                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            The scenario describes a project with mainly stable and known upfront elements, allowing the
                            project manager to apply a waterfall project management approach. Technical aspects of the
                            project, on the other hand, are not yet fully defined and will be elaborated as the project
                            progresses. This implies some agile practices will be required to manage these unclear
                            aspects, resulting in an overall hybrid project management approach. Project environments
                            subject to various elements of ambiguity and change have an inherent need to communicate
                            evolving and emerging details more frequently and quickly. In such environments, project
                            managers should encourage frequent team checkpoints, the use of information radiators, and
                            holding regular stakeholder reviews. While it is unclear whether sending the project report
                            on a weekly basis considered by the sponsor to be frequent enough, the incorrect answer
                            choices describe agile communication practices that would support the need for frequent and
                            quick communication of project information. Sending the project report on a weekly basis is
                            the only choice that stands out as "non-agile" and, therefore, will likely be an exception
                            to your selection of tools and techniques, making this choice the best answer to the
                            question asked.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Holding frequent team checkpoints<br>
                            Incorrect. Frequent team checkpoints refer to agile practices such as daily standups,
                            iteration reviews, retrospectives, etc. While it is unclear from the scenario if the team
                            can or need to meet daily and whether the deliverables are built using iterations, frequent
                            team checkpoints would address the sponsor request for more frequent and quick
                            communication.<br>
                            B. Conducting regular stakeholder reviews<br>
                            Incorrect. Unlike traditional projects where stakeholders are involved in key milestones and
                            gates, agile projects benefit from regular stakeholder reviews and continuous engagement.
                            Conducting regular stakeholder reviews would support the sponsor's request to have more
                            frequent and quick communications on the project.<br>
                            C. Implementing information radiators<br>
                            Incorrect. Information radiators are visible physical or digital displays that provide
                            information to the rest of the organization enabling up-to-the-minute knowledge sharing.
                            These displays help communicate progress, share issues, drive continuous improvement, and
                            manage stakeholder expectations.<br>
                            D. Communicating project status weekly<br>
                            Correct. It is unclear if weekly cadence considered by the sponsor to be frequent and quick
                            enough. However, of the choices provided, this option describes the practice that would
                            'least' likely support the need expressed by the sponsor to communicate project information
                            more frequently and quickly, making this choice the best answer to the question asked.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            Social media can be an effective tool for communication among stakeholders. Although social
                            media may be very prevalent in some regions, not all people embrace the use of social media,
                            especially when the stakeholders come from different cultures all across the world as
                            described by the scenario. Cultural awareness is an understanding of the difference between
                            individuals, groups, and organizations and adapting the project's communication strategy in
                            the context of these differences. While some of the project's stakeholders or team members
                            may be interested in using the social media tool, the requirement to create an account for
                            the tool may be challenging for others to get everyone engaged with the idea. Therefore, in
                            this scenario, people's reluctance to use the tool will likely be the biggest issue for the
                            project manager.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. The cost of the tool may be so high that it would negate the benefits of using the
                            tool<br>
                            Incorrect. While the question does not provide the specifics of the tool to be used, it is
                            unlikely that its cost would be so high to negate its benefits. Nowadays, there are many
                            free social media tools, and even those that have a charge are usually very affordable.<br>
                            B. The fact that everyone uses different computers and mobile devices for access<br>
                            Incorrect. Most social media applications are compatible with various platforms to ensure
                            widespread adoption. The fact that the stakeholders use different computers and mobile
                            devices is not likely to be a significant issue.<br>
                            C. Social media tools should never be allowed as a platform for project communications<br>
                            Incorrect. Although some companies may not allow the use of social media tools, these tools
                            have been used successfully on many projects. In recent years, companies have begun to
                            embrace social media as an effective communication tool. Absolute statements, such as
                            "never", "always", etc. typically represent incorrect answers.<br>
                            D. Some project stakeholders and team members would be reluctant to use the tool<br>
                            Correct. Since the group is diverse, some people may not feel comfortable using social media
                            for communications. Gaining broad acceptance of the tool will likely be the project
                            manager's biggest challenge.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            The project manager is wise to be concerned with knowledge management on the team, and
                            training meetings can be an effective way of getting team members to share information with
                            each other. However, given that some of the team members are new hires, this suggests that
                            the team members may not feel comfortable participating in discussions to exchange
                            knowledge. The most important part of knowledge management is creating an atmosphere of
                            trust so that people are motivated to share their knowledge and to pay attention to what
                            others know. Since the project manager has recently hired new staff, he may need to work on
                            team-building before managing project knowledge. Once trusting relationships have been
                            established, future training meetings will likely be more successful.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Meetings are not an efficient way to share and transfer knowledge with new team
                            members<br>
                            Incorrect. Meetings, particularly face-to-face meetings, can be an effective tool for
                            connecting people so they can work together to share tacit knowledge, create new knowledge,
                            and integrate the knowledge of diverse team members.<br>
                            B. The team has not yet built trusting relationships to feel free to ask questions, express
                            concerns, or share knowledge<br>
                            Correct. The most important part of knowledge management is creating an atmosphere of trust
                            so that people are motivated to share their knowledge or to pay attention to what others
                            know. The project manager has recently hired new staff, so he may need to work on
                            team-building first before managing project knowledge. Once trusting relationships have been
                            established, future training meetings will likely be more successful.<br>
                            C. The new hires are younger professionals who are accustomed to more interactive and
                            entertaining training<br>
                            Incorrect. Be sure to avoid answer choices that make generalizations about people and cannot
                            be supported by the information provided.<br>
                            D. Relying on discussions instead of having the team members document their knowledge in a
                            lessons learned register<br>
                            Incorrect. It is a common misconception that managing knowledge involves just documenting it
                            so it can be shared. It is difficult to document tacit knowledge (knowledge that is personal
                            and difficult to express, such as beliefs, insights, experience, and 'know-how') in the same
                            way as codified explicit knowledge; therefore, a lessons learned register might not be an
                            effective tool for to use in this situation. Face-to-face discussions can be a highly
                            effective way to share tacit knowledge, but in this scenario, the organization (or project
                            team) needs to create an atmosphere of trust so that the employees are motivated to share
                            their knowledge.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            Agile teams use boards to make their work visible and help manage their workflow. While
                            collocated teams may use either physical or digital boards, for a remote team, to
                            distribute, coordinate, and manage the workload effectively, having an effective tool, such
                            as a virtual board, is even more important.<br>
                            A newly formed team whose members have never met can benefit from getting to know each other
                            in a face-to-face onboarding meeting. Such a meeting is not always possible for various
                            reasons. However, if the organization is able to bring the team members together for the
                            face-to-face in-person meeting, the benefit of this arrangement would pay off in the long
                            term.<br>
                            When virtual team members struggle to coordinate work because of the different time zones,
                            asynchronous virtual communication tools may be helpful.<br>
                            For retrospective meetings, if team members find it difficult to voice their opinions
                            openly, anonymous feedback options will likely be a good alternative as it allows the
                            expression of views and feelings more honestly.<br>
                            Training includes the activities designed to enhance the competencies of the project team
                            members. Training can be formal or informal and can be carried out in a classroom setting or
                            online. In the scenario provided, online training would be an effective method to adopt new,
                            unfamiliar tools, such as the digital board.<br>
                            Lastly, remote pairing using virtual conferencing tools to share screens, including voice
                            and video chats, has proven almost as effective as face-to-face paring.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            The way the scenario is framed implies that a predictive project management approach has
                            been selected for the project. However, a high volume of new features, change requests, and
                            defect repairs suggest that agile or, at least, hybrid methods would have worked better.
                            While switching the project management approach midway into project execution is not always
                            feasible or advisable, unless stated otherwise in the scenario, the project manager, in
                            consultation with the team and relevant stakeholders, is free to choose any approach they
                            assume would work better. When agile practices "meet" a traditionally managed project, the
                            approach becomes hybrid. With agile methods, a product is built incrementally over the
                            course of short iterations. Progress can be measured frequently from iteration to iteration,
                            allowing the next iteration to be planned based on real progress rather than based on
                            estimates made up-front when little information about the project was available. When a
                            project operates in an environment full of new features, change requests, and defect
                            repairs, up-front estimating would likely be inaccurate. Therefore, switching the product
                            development approach to adaptive and measuring progress via short iterations is the best
                            course of action for the project manager to take in this situation<br>
                            Note: variance analysis used in the scenario is an example of data analysis tools and
                            techniques that can be applied with any of the processes of the Monitoring and Controlling
                            Process Group. This technique identifies the differences (variance) between planned and
                            actual performance.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Switch the product development approach to adaptive and measure progress via short
                            iterations<br>
                            Correct. The question asks to find the best approach to ensure that further estimates are
                            made based on real progress, with the "real progress" being the key words. With
                            adaptive/iterative approach, progress can be measured frequently, every iteration, thus
                            allowing the estimates for the upcoming iteration to be more realistic.<br>
                            B. Limit the number of new features, change requests, and defect repairs allowed on the
                            project<br>
                            Incorrect. It is true that predictive projects, such as the one described in the scenario,
                            try to minimize the number of changes. However, limiting the number of new features, change
                            requests, and defect repairs 'allowed' on the project, even one managed traditionally,
                            sounds like an unreasonable approach.<br>
                            C. Use a bottom-up estimating technique for cost and schedule, and three-point estimating
                            for scope<br>
                            Incorrect. This answer choice describes examples of various estimating techniques that could
                            be used to estimate cost and time. The term "estimating" is less applicable to scope.
                            Regardless, the question is asking about the best course of action to ensure that estimates
                            are made based on 'real progress'. None of these techniques are based on real progress.<br>
                            D. Measure progress based on the individual baselines instead of the single integrated
                            baseline<br>
                            Incorrect. This answer choice only slightly changes the way progress is measured on the
                            project since the performance measurement baseline is the integrated scope-schedule-cost
                            plan, which is derived from the three individual baselines. And since each individual
                            baseline is not developed based on real progress, this choice is an incorrect answer.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            The expectations of the project manager do not change in an adaptive environment, but
                            control of the detailed product planning and delivery is delegated to the team. The project
                            manager's focus is on building a collaborative decision-making environment and ensuring the
                            team has the ability to respond to changes. When an agile framework is being used, the
                            project manager assumes a more supportive role as a servant leader. The incorrect answer
                            choices are all examples of a project manager taking direct control over project planning
                            and work which is inconsistent with agile best practices. Therefore, of the available
                            choices, building a collaborative decision-making environment is the best answer to the
                            question asked.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Performing detailed product planning and delivery<br>
                            Incorrect. In an adaptive environment, control of the detailed product planning and delivery
                            is delegated to the project team rather than performed by the project manager.<br>
                            B. Building a collaborative decision-making environment<br>
                            Correct. When using an agile framework, the project manager's focus is on building a
                            collaborative decision-making environment and ensuring the team has the ability to respond
                            to changes.<br>
                            C. Holding the project team accountable for deadlines<br>
                            Incorrect. Agile teams are self-organizing, and they are empowered to organize and manage
                            their own work. Agile team members are held accountable by the team, and the project manager
                            assumes a more supportive role in guiding the team to achieve project objectives.<br>
                            D. Planning what will be accomplished during each iteration<br>
                            Incorrect. In an agile environment, it is the development team, not the project manager, who
                            plans the work that will be accomplished during each iteration as part of the iteration
                            planning meeting. The project manager's role is to act as the facilitator of the iteration
                            planning meeting.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            The Agile Manifesto Principles #12 states, "At regular intervals, the team reflects on how
                            to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly." The purpose of a
                            retrospective meeting is to provide team members an opportunity to analyze the processes the
                            team uses to develop the project deliverables and determine what improvements can be made so
                            that the next iteration (or next cycle in flow-based agile) will be more effective and
                            productive. These facilitated meetings may include the elements, such as setting up the
                            stage, gathering data, generating insights, deciding what to do, and finally closing the
                            retrospective. As stated by the Scrum Guide, "The Sprint Retrospective is an opportunity for
                            the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the
                            next Sprint".<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Demonstrating the product increment to the customer<br>
                            Incorrect. Demonstrating the product increment to the customer and relevant stakeholders is
                            part of the sprint review meeting. The team is looking for feedback on the product, rather
                            than on the process used by the team to develop the product. Sprint review meetings are not
                            intended for the team to reflect and adapt.<br>
                            B. Selecting user stories for the next sprint<br>
                            Incorrect. Selecting user stories for the next sprint typically happens at sprint planning
                            meetings. While some review to evaluate the team's progress may happen during the sprint
                            planning meeting, such as measuring the team's velocity to ensure the plan for the next
                            sprint sounds reasonable, this scrum event is not the right forum to reflect and adapt.<br>
                            C. Discussing the on-going work and impediments to progress<br>
                            Incorrect. The on-going work, such as the items completed the last day, work planned for
                            today, as well as any impediments to progress, are usually discussed at the daily standup
                            meetings. These meetings are short time-boxed events that are not aimed to reflect on and
                            adapt the processes used by the team.<br>
                            D. Looking for any improvements to the team's process<br>
                            Correct. Agile teams use sprint retrospective meetings to reflect on the processes used in
                            the latest sprint to develop the product and determine how to improve or adapt those
                            processes for the next sprint. A team facilitator, such as the scrum master, agile coach,
                            may take part in the meeting to help the team in their quest.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            Quantitative risk analysis is a reliable method to assess overall project risk which is
                            performed by assigning cost and schedule impacts to identified risks. However quantitative
                            risk analysis is not required for all projects nor is it always possible. The use of
                            quantitative risk analysis depends on the availability of numeric data that can be assigned
                            to project risks as well as specialized expertise. In addition, quantitative risk analysis
                            is costly and typically takes more time to complete than qualitative risk analysis.
                            Quantitative risk analysis is most likely appropriate for large or complex projects, which
                            is not the case in the scenario described where you are leading a small project. When
                            high-quality numeric data is unavailable, individual project risks are prioritized and
                            assessed in qualitative risk analysis, giving the team a list of high-priority risks on
                            which to focus their efforts. In situations where performing quantitative risk analysis is
                            prohibitive, a qualitative risk analysis will be sufficient for the project's risk
                            management efforts. In such instances, the project can proceed directly to the next process,
                            Plan Risk Responses, making it the best answer to the question asked.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Make up numeric data and evaluate on a quantitative basis<br>
                            Incorrect. Quantitatively evaluating risks is dependent on the ability to attain numerical
                            data about individual project risks. When the data is not available, the project can proceed
                            to the Plan Risk Responses process. While not ideal, this approach is better than making up
                            data, which on its own, is an action that violates the PMI Code of Ethics and Professional
                            Conduct.<br>
                            B. Release the project team and terminate the project<br>
                            Incorrect. Releasing the project team and terminating the project is an extreme reaction
                            that is not warranted under the circumstances described in the scenario. When high-quality
                            numeric data is not available to carry our the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process,
                            having the risks analyzed on a qualitative level and moving on to plan risk responses is a
                            good project management practice.<br>
                            C. Proceed directly to the Plan Risk Responses process<br>
                            Correct. A qualitative risk analysis prioritizes risks by their probability of occurrence
                            and impact allowing the team to focus efforts on high-priority risks. By trying to assign
                            cost impacts to risks, you are trying to use quantitative risk analysis which is not
                            appropriate for all projects. A quantitative risk analysis depends on the availability of
                            high-quality data for project risks. Since you are struggling with attaining such data, a
                            qualitative risk analysis will be sufficient.<br>
                            D. Request the numeric data from the project sponsor<br>
                            Incorrect. The problem described by the scenario is a lack of high-quality numeric data
                            required to evaluate project risks on a quantitative basis. It is possible but highly
                            unlikely that the project sponsor will possess or be able to obtain the required data.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            The Manage Stakeholder Engagement process is the process of communicating and working with
                            stakeholders to meet their needs and expectations, address issues, and foster the
                            appropriate stakeholder involvement. In order to effectively manage the new stakeholder's
                            level of engagement, the project manager must understand, among other things, the
                            stakeholder's requirements and expectations. Meeting with the stakeholder provides an
                            opportunity for the project manager to establish a relationship and gather the necessary
                            information from the stakeholder to engage her effectively. Therefore, of the available
                            options, the best course of action for the project manager to do is meet with the
                            stakeholder to learn the stakeholder's requirements and expectations for the project. The
                            incorrect answer choices represent actions that may not be necessary, or the project manager
                            does not have enough information to perform at this point.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Revise the stakeholder engagement assessment matrix<br>
                            Incorrect. The stakeholder engagement assessment matrix is a matrix that compares current
                            and desired stakeholder engagement levels. This information is not known until the project
                            manager has an opportunity to make an assessment of the stakeholder's engagement level.<br>
                            B. Submit a change request to update the stakeholder engagement plan<br>
                            Incorrect. It is likely that the stakeholder engagement plan will eventually need to be
                            updated to engage the new stakeholder. However, to do so, the project manager will have to
                            learn first about the new stakeholder's requirements and expectations as described by the
                            scenario. This information can be obtained using various approaches. Meeting with the
                            stakeholder is one of them.<br>
                            C. Update the RACI chart with the responsibilities of the new stakeholder<br>
                            Incorrect. A RACI chart is a type of responsibility assignment matrix (RAM) that uses
                            responsible, accountable, consult, and inform status to define the involvement of
                            stakeholders in project activities. At this point, the only information available about the
                            new stakeholder is that they have influence and will be responsible for a few aspects of the
                            project. The level of influence is not part of the RACI chart. Without knowing the exact
                            responsibilities of the stakeholder, updating the RACI chart is a premature action.<br>
                            D. Schedule a meeting with the new project stakeholder<br>
                            Correct. Meeting with the stakeholder provides an opportunity for the project manager to
                            gather the necessary information from the stakeholder to foster the appropriate level of
                            stakeholder involvement in the project.<br>

                            A cumulative flow diagram represents the overall flow of items, such as features or user
                            stories, through the system, for example, through a Kanban (task) board. Each significant
                            step in the process (or on the Kanban board) is represented by an area in the diagram. The
                            cumulative flow diagram shows the number of items at each of the steps in the process at any
                            given point in time. A bottleneck is what slows or limits the capacity of the process. Wide
                            bands mean that there is a blockage in the flow. Items accumulate as they don't move onto
                            the next step. Narrow bands mean that either work in progress (WIP) of that step is too
                            small or the team is unable to process the items in that step fast enough. In this diagram,
                            the widest band at this point in time (Day 8) is the Development, which is feeding into a
                            narrow band, Testing. It can be implied from the diagram and is reasonable to assume that
                            those responsible for testing have challenges with their tasks, or the WIP of the testing
                            column is too low. Hence, many development items are waiting for the testers to be pulled
                            out from the Development stage. Therefore, it can be concluded that in this cumulative flow
                            diagram, on Day 8, testing is the bottleneck in the process.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            The question implies that the project manager is performing the Plan Resource Management
                            process with the development of the resource management plan. The resource management plan
                            provides direction for how resources, including human resources, will be identified and
                            acquired for the project. When developing the resource requirements for a project
                            characterized by high variability and rapid change, the project manager should consider the
                            use of a self-organizing team of generalizing specialists. This strategy will provide much
                            greater flexibility and empowerment to the project team members to deal with what will
                            likely be a rather chaotic environment. It is important to keep in mind that in a project
                            with high variability and rapid changes, there will be less time for centralized tasking and
                            decision making.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Identify the most qualified individuals and include their names in the resource
                            management plan<br>
                            Incorrect. Obviously, the project manager will want the most qualified individuals for the
                            project team. However, the resource management plan describes 'how' the resources will be
                            acquired rather than the names of specific individuals. The project team members should be
                            identified as part of the Acquire Resources process rather than the Plan Resource Management
                            process implied by the scenario.<br>
                            B. Specify agile as the development approach in the resource management plan<br>
                            Incorrect. Agile methodologies would be a good choice for a project with a high degree of
                            variability and rapid change. However, the development approach should be captured in the
                            project management plan as a separate component rather than a resource management plan.<br>
                            C. Describe the selection process to acquire a project team comprised of subject matter
                            experts<br>
                            Incorrect. Projects that are characterized by high variability and rapid change benefit from
                            self-organizing teams of generalizing specialists instead of subject matter experts. Subject
                            matter experts are, by definition, highly specialized and may lack the flexibility to be
                            successful in a chaotic environment.<br>
                            D. Consider a self-organizing team of generalizing specialists<br>
                            Correct. When considering resource requirements for a project characterized by high
                            variability and rapid changes, the project manager should consider using a self-organizing
                            team of generalizing specialists. This team structure will provide greater collaboration and
                            flexibility to better deal with the chaotic environment.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            According to lean product development best practices, agile leaders delegate tasks to the
                            team to avoid both micromanagement and abdication. This concept is known as team
                            empowerment, which is a fundamental aspect of servant leadership. Lean thinking includes the
                            ability to delegate work while still retaining responsibility for the outcomes. Retaining
                            the responsibility can be accomplished using visual controls, where a manager can see the
                            team's process, see how the team is doing at any time, and see the team's outcomes. If the
                            team members get into trouble, the manager can actively coach them to improve their results
                            without telling them specifically what to do.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Waste elimination<br>
                            Incorrect. Eliminating waste in lean refers to reducing work in progress, decreasing
                            partially done work, eliminating delays, and focusing on building the right features.
                            Delegating work to the team and encouraging them to make local decisions as described in the
                            scenario covers a different lean concept.<br>
                            B. Fast failure<br>
                            Incorrect. The idea behind fast failure, as it pertains to lean-agile project management, is
                            that if the project is doomed to fail, it's better to happen earlier than later to minimize
                            the waste of resources. While delegating duties to the team members and allowing them to
                            make local decisions may result in a failure, the failure is not the goal here. It's a
                            possible (and unwanted) outcome. The goal is team empowerment.<br>
                            C. Team empowerment<br>
                            Correct. Agile teams are known to be self-organizing, self-directing, and empowered to make
                            decisions related to their work. Delegating some of the duties to the team lead as well as
                            encouraging the team members to make local decisions supports the concept of team
                            empowerment, making this choice the best answer to the question asked.<br>
                            D. Workflow visualization<br>
                            Incorrect. Visualizing the workflow is typically accomplished through the use of a Kanban
                            board. A Kanban board helps the team manage the flow of work tasks that are planned to be
                            completed during the course of the project. Workflow visualization is only one aspect of
                            what the project manager is trying to achieve in the scenario described.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            The quality management plan defines the acceptable level of project and product quality and
                            describes how to ensure this level of quality in its deliverables and processes. The quality
                            management plan also describes what to do with nonconforming products and what corrective
                            action to implement. Therefore, reviewing the quality management plan is what the project
                            manager should do next.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Perform the Plan Quality Management process<br>
                            Incorrect. The question implies that the project is in execution, which indicates that
                            project planning, including the Plan Quality Management process, has already been
                            completed.<br>
                            B. Review the quality management plan to determine what to do with the nonconforming
                            products<br>
                            Correct. The quality management plan will provide guidance to determine what to do with the
                            nonconforming products and what action to implement.<br>
                            C. Document the findings and repair the deliverables<br>
                            Incorrect. While documenting the findings is indeed an appropriate action, repairing the
                            deliverables without submitting a change request or seeking guidance in the quality
                            management plan goes against proper project management practices.<br>
                            D. Review the risk report to gain guidance on what corrective action should be
                            implemented<br>
                            Incorrect. The risk report is used in the Manage Quality process to identify sources of
                            overall project risk and the most important drivers of overall risk exposure that can impact
                            the quality objectives of the project. The risk report does not provide guidance on how to
                            handle nonconforming products.<br>

                          <div class="specificfeedback">Your answer is incorrect.<br>
                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            The question suggests that the Monitor Risks process is underway, and project documents
                            including the risk register may be updated during this process. The risk register should be
                            updated to reflect the status of the unrealized risk. Also, since the identified risk did
                            not occur, the unused contingency reserve may be removed from the project budget to free up
                            resources for other projects or operations. Updating the risk register and releasing the
                            funds is what you should do next. While the choice: “Update the lessons learned register to
                            reflect that the contingency reserve was not necessary” is a plausible answer, it is not
                            what the project manager would do 'next', it is something the project manager could do to
                            ensure the information is available to other projects. This would be done after the risk
                            register was updated and the contingency funds released.<br>
                            Note, since the contingency reserves are part of the cost baseline, an approved change
                            request would be required to release the funds. However, this option is not provided.
                            Therefore, of the choices given, updating the risk register and releasing the associated
                            contingency reserves is the best answer to the question asked.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Update the risk register and release the contingency reserves associated with the
                            risk<br>
                            Correct. The risk register should be updated to reflect the status of the outdated risk.
                            Also, since the identified risk did not occur, the unused contingency reserve may be removed
                            from the project budget to free up resources for other projects or operations.<br>
                            B. Update the risk register and keep the contingency reserve as an added buffer for overall
                            project risk<br>
                            Incorrect. The contingency reserve assigned to an individual project risk can only be used
                            for that identified risk. If the risk does not occur, the associated contingency reserve
                            should be released from the project budget.<br>
                            C. Inform the project sponsor and stakeholders that all the equipment has been provided<br>
                            Incorrect. The communication management plan should be consulted to determine what
                            communications should be shared and with whom. Since this information is not provided in the
                            scenario, it is reasonable to assume that the action represented by this answer choice is
                            unlikely to be your next step.<br>
                            D. Update the lessons learned register to reflect that the contingency reserve was not
                            necessary<br>
                            Incorrect. The fact that the risk did not occur does not mean the risk did not exist when
                            the contingency reserve was assigned, so this should be captured somewhere or perhaps in
                            more than one document. Although the risk did not occur on this project, it could occur on a
                            future project, which supports documenting the risk and its status or impact. The first
                            action to take with the unneeded contingency reserve set aside for the risk that didn’t
                            occur is to update the risk register to reflect the change in project risk and release the
                            funds.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            Validate Scope is the process of formalizing acceptance of the completed project
                            deliverables. Validating scope includes reviewing deliverables with the customer or sponsor
                            to ensure that they are completed satisfactorily and obtaining formal acceptance of
                            deliverables by the customer or sponsor.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Control Scope<br>
                            Incorrect. Control Scope is the process of monitoring the status of the project and product
                            scope and managing changes to the scope baseline. Deliverables are not inspected for
                            acceptance during the Control Scope process.<br>
                            B. Validate Scope<br>
                            Correct. The Validate Scope process includes reviewing deliverables with the customer or
                            sponsor to ensure that they are completed satisfactorily and obtaining formal acceptance of
                            deliverables by the customer or sponsor.<br>
                            C. Manage Quality<br>
                            Incorrect. Manage Quality is the process of translating the quality management plan into
                            executable quality activities that incorporate the organization’s quality policies into the
                            project. Manage Quality is part of the Executing Process Group, and deliverable acceptance
                            is part of the Monitoring and Controlling Process Group.<br>
                            D. Perform Quality Control<br>
                            Incorrect. 'Perform Quality Control' is not a process specified in the PMBOK® Guide.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            The scenario describes a hybrid project with one phase that can be managed using waterfall
                            methods where requirements are well-defined up front, and another phase that has unclear
                            requirements, warranting the use of an agile project management approach. The second phase
                            appears to have a high degree of complexity and uncertainty. Under such circumstances, the
                            requirements for the second phase will have to be elaborated as the phase progresses and
                            more information becomes available. However, even during the initial planning, to overcome
                            uncertainty, agile/hybrid projects (or phases) may benefit from involving as many team
                            members and stakeholders as possible. This approach allows for soliciting a wide range of
                            various inputs that can be incorporated into early project plans and then used as a basis
                            for further elaboration during project execution.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Ensure that the work breakdown structure is as detailed as possible<br>
                            Incorrect. According to the scenario, requirements for the second phase, the development of
                            the satellite, are known only at a high level. It will be highly unlikely and challenging to
                            develop a detailed work breakdown structure. The requirements will have to be elaborated as
                            the phase progresses.<br>
                            B. Select only those vendors who are on the preapproved seller list<br>
                            Incorrect. There is not enough information in the scenario to determine that vendors on the
                            preapproved seller list should get priority over those who are not on the list. Regardless,
                            selecting vendors is part of the Conduct Procurements process, while the question is
                            concerned with the best approach to planning.<br>
                            C. Assign a dedicated team member to monitor the quality of deliverables<br>
                            Incorrect. Quality roles and responsibilities are specified in the quality management plan.
                            It is possible that a dedicated team member will be assigned to monitor the quality of the
                            deliverables. However, monitoring quality is an activity associated with the Monitoring and
                            Controlling Process Group, while the question is asking about planning.<br>
                            D. Involve as many project team members and stakeholders as possible<br>
                            Correct. Involving as many project team members and stakeholders as possible during initial
                            project planning reduce uncertainty as the inputs from the team and stakeholders are
                            incorporated into the plans allowing for a better understanding of what should be done to
                            produce the project deliverables.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            The question describes a discussion or negotiation between a project manager and a
                            department manager for a shared resource. The project manager is hoping to acquire the
                            resource as part of his project team. If successful the project manager will reach an
                            agreement with the department manager that will allow the use of one of the departmental
                            resources to contribute work to the project.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Resource calendar<br>
                            Incorrect. Although the discussion between the project manager and the department manager
                            involves scheduling and sharing a resource, there is no mention in the question of the
                            specific information such as working days, shifts, business hours, resource availability, or
                            other information typically contained in a resource calendar.<br>
                            B. Negotiation<br>
                            Correct. This question shows the project manager contacting the department manager to
                            request a resource to use on the project. The project manager proposes a schedule that would
                            allow the resource to be shared between her department and the project. This is a
                            negotiation between the project manager and the department manager. Negotiation is aimed at
                            reaching an agreement and is an interpersonal and team skill used as a technique of the
                            Acquire Resources process.<br>
                            C. Decision making<br>
                            Incorrect. Decision making techniques such as multicriteria decision analysis involve using
                            a selection criteria for rating or scoring potential resources. In this scenario, the
                            project manager is seeking to acquire an identified resource from the department manager’s
                            team and there is no indication that their discussion involves rating or scoring of the
                            resource.<br>
                            D. Pre-assignment<br>
                            Incorrect. Pre-assignment occurs when team members are selected in advance, typically based
                            on the expertise of a particular person. The information in the question does not indicate
                            that this resource has been pre-assigned or possesses a particular skill or type of
                            expertise.<br>

                          either the schedule baseline will be unattainable, or some work packages will have to be
                          removed from the WBS. What is the best course of action for the project manager?</div>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            An information radiator is a visible display that provides information to the rest of the
                            organization enabling up-to-the-minute knowledge sharing without having to disturb the team.
                            If it is determined that the project is behind schedule, a decision has to be made as to
                            what are the next steps to bring the project in line with the plan. According to the Agile
                            Manifesto principle #8, agile processes promote sustainable development. Working overtime
                            may cause team members to become frustrated, lead to reduced productivity, and eventually
                            get burnt out. On occasions, for short periods, teams may be required to work extra hours.
                            However, in order to understand whether such an effort is required in this situation, other
                            available alternatives should be considered first. According to the scenario, reducing
                            project scope is an option. However, since the product development is carried out using
                            agile practices, the product owner should be consulted. Crashing is a schedule compression
                            technique used to shorten the schedule duration. Working overtime or adding resources are
                            examples of crashing.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Raise the issue with the team at the next iteration retrospective<br>
                            Incorrect. An iteration retrospective is held after the iteration is over. According to the
                            scenario, the current iteration is the last one for the project. Therefore, waiting for the
                            issue to be discussed at the retrospective of the last iteration would be too late.<br>
                            B. Meet with the product owner and suggest crashing the schedule<br>
                            Correct. On agile projects, or on projects where the scope is developed using agile
                            practices, as implied by the scenario, the product owner is responsible for the scope
                            (product backlog). The project manager has to meet the product owner and decide on whether
                            to remove some work packages (user stories) from the WBS (backlog) and complete the work
                            with the existing resources or crash the schedule to complete all originally planned work
                            without reducing scope.<br>
                            C. Request that the scrum master find the root cause for the delay<br>
                            Incorrect. Eventually, the root cause for the dealy will have to be determined so that the
                            knowledge gained will be used to improve the future performance of the team. However, under
                            the circumstances described in the scenario, it is more important to find the solution for
                            the current issue, which is the unattainable schedule baseline or reduced scope.<br>
                            D. Ask the team to work overtime to meet all the project objectives<br>
                            Incorrect. While at times, it is acceptable to work overtime to meet project objectives,
                            working overtime could be detrimental to the product quality as team members may become
                            weary. The scenario implies that reducing the project scope is an option. Therefore, before
                            asking the team to work overtime, other alternatives should be considered first.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            The question suggests that the Plan Cost Management process is being performed, which is the
                            process of defining how the project costs will be estimated, budgeted, managed, monitored,
                            and controlled. The project charter provides the preapproved financial resources from which
                            the detailed project costs are developed. The project charter also defines the project
                            approval requirements that will influence the management of the project costs. Therefore,
                            you should review the project charter to see if there are any preapproved financial
                            resources from which the detailed project costs can be developed.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Consult the cost management plan<br>
                            Incorrect. The question suggests that the Plan Cost Management process is being performed;
                            therefore, the cost management plan has yet to be created, and this option can be
                            eliminated.<br>
                            B. Review the project charter<br>
                            Correct. The project charter provides the preapproved financial resources from which the
                            detailed project costs are developed. The project charter also defines the project approval
                            requirements that will influence the management of the project costs. Therefore, reviewing
                            the project charter is what you should do next to complete the process described in the
                            scenario.<br>
                            C. Examine the basis of estimates for the project<br>
                            Incorrect. The basis of estimates includes supporting documentation outlining the details
                            used in establishing project estimates. The basis of estimates does not provide information
                            on pre-approved financial resources, making this answer choice incorrect.<br>
                            D. Check the cost baseline<br>
                            Incorrect. The cost baseline is the approved version of the time-phased project budget,
                            excluding any management reserves. The question implies that the Plan Cost Management
                            process is underway; therefore, the cost baseline has yet to be determined.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            In a large organization, a transition from a predictive (traditional) project management
                            approach to an agile one does not happen overnight. It is likely to be a long and,
                            sometimes, painful process. If appropriately implemented, the project management approach
                            will gradually shift from traditional to hybrid to agile. The first step, transitioning from
                            predictive to hybrid, can be done by incorporating some of the agile elements into the
                            existing predictive practices. Three answer choices describe practices used on agile
                            projects. They include but are not limited to, developing the product in short iterations,
                            incorporating daily standup meetings into the team's routine, holding team retrospectives at
                            the end of each iteration, and many others. Only tracking the project progress using weekly
                            meetings is a practice that is typically used on predictive projects. On agile projects,
                            progress is readily available 24/7/365 using information radiators. Therefore, of the
                            choices provided, tracking the project progress using weekly meetings is the least likely
                            option for you to select.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Developing the product in two- to four-week iterations<br>
                            Incorrect. Unlike traditional projects, in which the product is developed during the entire
                            period of project execution and then delivered at the end of the project, agile projects
                            develop working product increments within short, typically two- to four-week iterations.
                            This practice would help with the transition, making this choice an incorrect answer.<br>
                            B. Incorporating daily standup meetings into the team's routine<br>
                            Incorrect. The daily standup is a meeting that is used by project teams that typically work
                            on agile projects. Adding this practice to a daily routine of the teams that work on
                            predictive projects may help the organization with its transition from the predictive to
                            agile project management approach, and is, therefore, not the 'least' likely option.<br>
                            C. Tracking the project progress using weekly meetings<br>
                            Correct. Tracking the project progress using weekly meetings is an approach which is very
                            typical for traditional projects. Since the question is asking for the 'least' likely option
                            to help with the transition from the predictive to agile project methods, this choice
                            represents the best answer to the question asked.<br>
                            D. Holding team retrospectives at the end of each iteration<br>
                            Incorrect. As part of continuous improvement efforts, agile teams hold retrospectives after
                            each completed iteration. This practice may help the organization with its desire to
                            transition from the traditional to the agile project management approach. Therefore, this
                            choice is not the 'least' likely option and, hence, an incorrect answer.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            A generalized specialist is one who can perform tasks outside their traditional job title.
                            For example, software programmers may, at times, have to write functional tests, testers may
                            work on technical code reviews, and integrators serve as business analysts. This type of
                            team composition allows the team to be more effective because it reduces hand-offs from one
                            person to another and prevents potential bottlenecks. In other words, the best combination
                            of skills for an agile team member is to have specific expertise plus a breadth of
                            experience across multiple skills, rather than a single specialization.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Experienced with the dynamic systems software development methods (DSDM)<br>
                            Incorrect. It is unclear from the scenario whether the DSDM is the software development
                            method that will be used in the project. Besides, having only this skill would make the team
                            member narrowly specialized and being unable to help colleagues when and if they face a
                            bottleneck.<br>
                            B. Self-starter and proficient in the automated testing processes and procedures<br>
                            Incorrect. Self-starter is a great characteristic to have when an individual joins a new
                            team, project, organization. Knowing how to implement automated testing is also great skill
                            in an agile team. However, agile team members should be versatile and being able to perform
                            in may roles. Developing a software (or any other deliverable) would likely require more
                            than just a testing skill.<br>
                            C. Has a focused specialty as well as a breadth of experience across multiple skills<br>
                            Correct. Agile teams aim to have generalized specialists so that any team member can perform
                            tasks outside of their traditional role. This means the team members have to have a focused
                            specialty as well as a breadth of experience across multiple skills.<br>
                            D. Team player and briefly familiar with all agile software development tools<br>
                            Incorrect. This choice seems to be a plausible answer. By definition, an agile team needs
                            team players. Being familiar with all agile software development tools also sounds like a
                            great asset. However, the key to eliminate this answer choice is the word "briefly". Being
                            "briefly familiar with all agile software development tools" sounds as if the individual is
                            "a jack of all trades and master of none." Being a master of a specific skill, e.g.,
                            software development, but also able to fill in the role of a tester, integrator, business
                            analyst, etc., would be a better combination.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            'Barely sufficient' is the agile term used to describe the approach of doing only as much as
                            is necessary to accomplish the work without including non-value added activities.
                            Documentation is generally considered less valuable to the customer than working software,
                            so work on documentation should be limited to producing only what is minimally necessary, or
                            'barely sufficient', leaving more time to focus on creating working software. This approach
                            is supported by the Agile Manifesto value #2, which states, "We value working software over
                            comprehensive documentation."<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Fractionally assigned<br>
                            Incorrect. An agile project team is said to be 'fractionally assigned' when one or more team
                            members are not 100% fully dedicated to one project.<br>
                            B. Servant leadership<br>
                            Incorrect. Servant leadership is the practice of leading through service to the team by
                            focusing on understanding and addressing the needs and development of the team members in
                            order to enable the highest possible team performance.<br>
                            C. Barely sufficient<br>
                            Correct. 'Barely sufficient' is the agile term used to describe the approach of doing only
                            as much as is necessary to accomplish the work without including non-value added activities.
                            Since documentation is often considered as bearing less value than the actual product, the
                            concept the product owner is trying to explain to the stakeholder can be best described as
                            'barely sufficient'.<br>
                            D. Pair programming<br>
                            Incorrect. Pair programming is a core practice typically used by agile teams who apply
                            eXtreme Programming (XP) software development method, in which software code is co-written
                            by two developers working as a pair.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            The Tuckman ladder includes five stages of development that teams may go through. The stages
                            include: forming, storming, norming, performing, and adjourning. Understanding the Tuckman
                            ladder concept is an important concept of the Develop Team process because the project
                            manager's management style can change from stage to stage. The project manager's
                            frustrations may be alleviated by understanding the natural progression of the Tuckman
                            ladder, especially team development efforts that are typical at the beginning of a
                            project.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Theory X<br>
                            Incorrect. Theory X was conceived by Douglas McGregor and describes a management style where
                            workers need a lot of direction and oversight. Although the project manager may practice
                            McGregor's theory, it is not a theory about a project team's development stages, but a
                            theory concerning management style.<br>
                            B. Hierarchy of needs<br>
                            Incorrect. Hierarchy of needs is Abraham Maslow's idea that humans are motivated by five
                            different layers of motivational factors ranging from basic needs to self-actualization.
                            Hierarchy of needs concerns an individual's motivational factors and has little relevance to
                            the development of a project team.<br>
                            C. Three needs theory<br>
                            Incorrect. The three needs theory from David McClelland has the premise that workers are
                            motivated by three factors: achievements, affiliation, and power. It is a motivational
                            theory that can be used in managing a team member but does not concern the progressions a
                            team may go through during the project.<br>
                            D. Tuckman ladder<br>
                            Correct. Developed by Bruce Tuckman, the Tuckman ladder is a model used to describe the
                            development phases a team goes through and helps direct the management style of the group.
                            The five phases of a team's development are named Forming, Storming, Norming, Performing and
                            Adjourning. Knowing these phases may help alleviate the project manager's frustrations.<br>

                          in the contractors. Which of the following was the most likely reason for this decision?</div>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            In this scenario, the ROI for using internal resources was estimated to be 25% versus
                            outsourcing with an ROI of 20%. Based on these estimates, it is more profitable to hire the
                            additional developers compared with using contractors to complete the project work. Based on
                            profitability alone, the logical decision is to hire the additional developers and conduct
                            the project internally. However, other considerations beyond profitability should be taken
                            into account. One important consideration includes the financial obligation for providing
                            employment to the newly hired developers after the project is concluded. If the performing
                            organization feels that they will not need additional developers after the current project
                            is complete, then it may make sense to use contractors instead of hiring developers even
                            though the project will be less profitable as a result. Therefore, of the available options,
                            the most likely reason to use contractors in this scenario is to avoid expanding permanent
                            employment obligations.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. To avoid expanding permanent employment obligations<br>
                            Correct. If the performing organization feels that they will not need additional developers
                            after the current project is complete, then it may make sense to use contractors instead of
                            hiring developers even though the project will be less profitable as a result.<br>
                            B. To reduce the project costs by using less expensive contractors<br>
                            Incorrect. There is not enough information in the question to determine that the contractors
                            were estimated to be less expensive than internal resources. In fact, the estimated ROI
                            indicates that it would be more profitable to use internal resources than contractors.<br>
                            C. To protect confidential information and intellectual property<br>
                            Incorrect. If the company wanted to protect its confidential information and intellectual
                            property, the company would unlikely involve external contractors in the project work.<br>
                            D. To complete the project faster by shortening its duration by 5%<br>
                            Incorrect. It cannot be determined based on the information provided in the question if
                            supplementing the existing team with contractors would have resulted in completing the
                            project faster and by what percentage. The 5% is the difference between the ROI values and
                            has nothing to do with the project duration.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            The scenario describes a hybrid project that starts with traditional project management
                            practices, where the project manager assigns tasks to the team members, and gradually
                            transitions to agile with the help of the agile coach who guides the team as the project
                            progresses. Experienced agile teams are self-organizing and empowered to make decisions
                            related to their work. Rather than selecting and sequencing work, the project manager
                            explains higher-level objectives to the team, and the team members are empowered to
                            self-organize specific tasks as a group to best meet those objectives. The team in the
                            scenario is not yet knowledgeable in agile practices. Therefore, before reaching this
                            empowered team state, the team members need guidance from an experienced agile practitioner,
                            such as the agile coach. It is also possible, at this stage, that work is assigned to the
                            team members by the project manager. Iteration retrospectives are used to review the process
                            the team uses to complete their tasks and determine what works well and what could be
                            improved. The use of iterations supports such continuous improvement, allowing the team to
                            improve their agile practices from iteration to iteration and, eventually, acquire the
                            skills required to perform without coaching.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Attend daily standup meetings<br>
                            Incorrect. The daily standup is a meeting used by the team to report on work done since the
                            previous daily standup, work planned for today, and any impediments to progress. These
                            meetings provide little information as to the ability of the team to perform without
                            coaching.<br>
                            B. Conduct product demonstrations<br>
                            Incorrect. Product demonstrations, which in agile are called iteration reviews, are meetings
                            used by the team to demonstrate the product increment developed during the recent iteration.
                            These meetings are focused on the product, while the question is concerned with the team,
                            asking if the team is capable to perform without coaching.<br>
                            C. Hold iteration retrospectives<br>
                            Correct. Iteration retrospectives are used by teams to review their work process and
                            improve. In the scenario, the agile coach guides the team through their first iterations,
                            including the retrospectives. The retrospectives will allow the coach and team to determine
                            if the team is mature enough in their agile practices to perform without further
                            coaching.<br>
                            D. Carry out team building activities<br>
                            Incorrect. Team building activities can help in enhancing the team's social relations and
                            building a collaborative working environment. While these activities may contribute to the
                            ability of the team to work as a group, merely carrying out these activities would not help
                            evaluate if the team is indeed ready to perform the actual work without coaching.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            The project schedule is one of the inputs to the Conduct Procurements process. The project
                            schedule identifies the start and end dates of project activities, including procurement
                            activities. It also defines when contractor deliverables are due. Of the available choices,
                            only the project schedule provides both the planned start and finish dates of project
                            activities, for example, drywall installation and walls painting.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Terms of reference<br>
                            Incorrect. Terms of reference (TOR) is the phrase that sometimes used when contracting for
                            services. TOR may include elements, such as tasks of the contractor, standards the
                            contractor will have to adhere to, list of services to be provided, etc. The definition of
                            the schedule for initial submission can be included in the TOR. However, the final dates are
                            specified in the project schedule, not in TOR.<br>
                            B. Resource breakdown structure<br>
                            Incorrect. The resource breakdown structure is a project document that hierarchically
                            represents resources by their category and type. The resource breakdown structure may
                            include details such as labor, material, equipment, supplies, skill level, required
                            certifications, etc. However, this project document does not specify the dates a resource
                            (either human or physical) would be applied to a project activity.<br>
                            C. Project schedule<br>
                            Correct. The project schedule identifies the start and end dates of project activities,
                            including procurement activities. It also defines when contractor deliverables are due.<br>
                            D. Requirements traceability matrix<br>
                            Incorrect. The requirements traceability matrix is a grid that links product requirements
                            from their origin to the deliverables that satisfy them. However, the requirements
                            traceability matrix is not a source for vendor start and finish dates.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            The question describes a project that will use agile methodologies, including
                            constraint-driven delivery. Constraint driven delivery is a common strategy for agile
                            projects, where the cost and/or time are fixed, and the scope is allowed to vary. Such
                            projects will require greater flexibility and a more collaborative relationship with vendors
                            as compared to a traditional waterfall approach. The correct answer choices represent
                            tactics that support the need for collaboration and provide greater flexibility. The
                            incorrect answer choices are indicative of strategies that are better suited to a predictive
                            model and unlikely to be used for an agile project.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Develop the procurement statement of work based on the detailed WBS<br>
                            Incorrect. When using an agile approach, the product scope will be progressively elaborated
                            rather than planned in advance. Therefore, a detailed work breakdown structure (WBS) is
                            unlikely to be produced during initial project planning.<br>
                            B. Pursue a shared-risk-reward relationship with the vendors<br>
                            Correct. Agile methodologies are dependant upon a collaborative approach with project
                            stakeholders and vendors. This collaborative approach can be supported by ensuring that both
                            sides share in the risks and rewards associated with the project.<br>
                            C. Adopt fixed-price increments when contracting with the vendors<br>
                            Correct. When using agile methodologies, the entire project scope may not be known upfront.
                            One solution is to contract for micro-deliverables such as user stories, which provides much
                            greater flexibility and better supports the evolution of the product scope throughout the
                            project.<br>
                            D. Utilize a standard firm-fixed-price contract for each of the vendors<br>
                            Incorrect. A firm-fixed-price contract (PPF) is commonly used with traditional waterfall
                            projects. However, when using agile methodologies, the project scope may not be well-defined
                            upfront. Therefore, the PPF contract will not likely be a practical solution.<br>
                            E. Include an early cancellation option in the vendor contracts<br>
                            Correct. With constraint-driven delivery, the cost and/or time are fixed, and the scope is
                            allowed to vary. Under such circumstances, it is possible that only part of the scope will
                            be delivered. Including an early cancellation option in the contract provides the customer
                            with the flexibility to end the project once sufficient value has been delivered or the
                            project has reached the funding and/or time limit. The vendor is usually protected by the
                            inclusion of an early cancellation fee, so both sides benefit from the arrangement.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            The project manager needs to verify whether or not the chairperson had the authority to
                            overrule the CCB's decision on the change request. The responsibility assignment matrix,
                            work breakdown structure, and project team assignments contain information about project
                            roles and responsibilities, but not specifically about the change control process. For that
                            information, the project manager should consult the change management plan, which is
                            specifically designed to provide direction for managing the change control process and
                            documenting the roles and responsibilities of the CCB. The change management plan would
                            specify the number of people needed to pass a vote, who has the authority to break ties when
                            voting on change requests, and who may have the ability to overrule the committee.
                            Therefore, the change management plan would be the best document to reference for
                            verification of the chairperson's scope of authority.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Check the project team assignments<br>
                            Incorrect. Project team assignments is a project document that provides information on the
                            type of competencies and experience available in the project and the knowledge that may be
                            missing. The project manager needs a document that will clarify the roles and
                            responsibilities of the CCB. However, the project team assignments document does not provide
                            this information.<br>
                            B. Review the responsibility assignment matrix<br>
                            Incorrect. A responsibility assignment matrix (RAM) is a grid that shows the project
                            resources assigned to each work package. Since the CCB is responsible for managing the
                            change control process rather than executing work packages, the RAM is not designed to
                            detail roles and responsibilities, as well as the rules and procedures, for the change
                            control process.<br>
                            C. Research the work breakdown structure<br>
                            Incorrect. The work breakdown structure (WBS) is designed to show how project deliverables
                            are broken down into work packages and provide a way of showing high-level areas of
                            responsibility. The WBS does not describe the project’s change control process or the roles
                            and responsibilities of CCB members.<br>
                            D. Examine the change management plan<br>
                            Correct. The change management plan provides the direction for managing the change control
                            process and documents the roles and responsibilities of the CCB. Because the change
                            management plan defines each committee member’s role and level of authority within the
                            group, and committee rules and procedures for decision-making, it would also specify the
                            number of people needed to pass a vote, who has the authority to break ties when voting on
                            change requests, and who may have the ability to overrule the committee in certain cases.
                            For this reason, the change management plan would be the best document for the project
                            manager to reference for clarification on the roles and responsibilities of CCB members and
                            to verify if the chairperson has the authority to make the decision described in the
                            scenario.<br>

                          its aspects using agile methods. The project manager is concerned that agile may not be the
                          best approach given that a large effort would be needed for additional processes, structure
                          and support systems, thus making the execution of the project more rigid and less agile. Which
                          of the following practices will assist in scaling this project while keeping some of its
                          aspects agile and less process and structure focused?</div>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            Incorporating some of the agile elements into a large and complex traditionally managed
                            project is frequently a challenge. Agile practices encourage high visibility of work, which
                            is not always the case with traditional projects. As it pertains to release management, on
                            smaller projects that are lead using agile, the product backlog is sufficient to manage the
                            project and provide enough visibility to the team and stakeholders. As a hybrid project
                            grows in size and complexity, to help establish both product focus and project visibility, a
                            release planning session and a release plan are required. The use of multi-level release
                            planning can ensure that both product focus and project visibility remain high and that
                            there is a clear product roadmap that ties together the entire project effort. Agile release
                            planning provides a high-level summary timeline of the release schedule based on the product
                            roadmap and the product vision. Agile release planning also determines the number of
                            iterations in the release and allows the product owner and team to decide on the amount of
                            work to be done and the timeline for this work to be completed.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Executing the project with a well-defined beginning and end<br>
                            Incorrect. A project that is planned and executed with a well-defined beginning and end is
                            non-agile in its very nature. Agile project management focuses on the continuous delivery of
                            value and working product, and not specifically on a predetermined beginning and end.<br>
                            B. Creating a detailed work breakdown structure (WBS)<br>
                            Incorrect. A WBS is a hierarchical decomposition of the project work. While it is possible
                            to combine some of the agile practices with traditional methods, making the project hybrid
                            as is in the scenario described, creating a detailed WBS would likely interfere with the
                            goal of keeping some of the project aspects agile and less process and structure
                            focused.<br>
                            C. Building a strict hierarchy of processes and decision making<br>
                            Incorrect. Building a hierarchy of processes and decision making focuses the project on
                            documentation, adherence, and ceremony, and away from the delivery of value and increments
                            of function or value. While large projects are often planned with a hierarchy of
                            functionality, this is much different from hierarchical processes and decision-making.<br>
                            D. Managing the project using multi-level release planning<br>
                            Correct. Multi-level release planning establishes a roadmap for how the team intends to
                            achieve the product vision within project objectives and constraints. Large agile projects
                            often use multi-level release plans in order to coordinate the greater complexity and tasks
                            that tend to increase with the size of the project.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            This question is a good example of questions that might be encountered in the real exam,
                            forcing the student to choose between two potentially correct answers. In this case, a
                            detailed agenda and a skilled facilitator both may have been beneficial in making the
                            meeting more productive. The PMP aspirant must choose the 'best' answer of the options
                            presented whether or not the question asks for the 'best' response. Of course, in the real
                            world, you would elect to have both a skilled facilitator and a detailed agenda, but the PMP
                            exam will expect the PMP aspirant to decide which answer will provide a better outcome.<br>
                            A facilitator can help keep you, and everyone else, on track. Lessons learned sessions don’t
                            deliver any value when the discussion only focuses on what went wrong. A facilitator can
                            help guide the group to turn negatives into positives by eliciting what can be done
                            differently in the future and develop concrete actions to make sure the problems do not
                            recur on the project. Developing a detailed agenda might have been a helpful tool to keep
                            the meeting on track and make sure that more was discussed other than just what went wrong.
                            However, as anyone with experience in running meetings knows, an agenda by itself will not
                            keep a meeting on track. A skilled facilitator can ensure that meeting objectives are met
                            with or without a detailed agenda. Therefore, of the available choices, using a skilled
                            facilitator provides the best strategy to ensure meeting objectives are met.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Development of a more detailed agenda for the meeting<br>
                            Incorrect. Developing a detailed agenda might have been a helpful tool to keep the meeting
                            on track and make sure that more was discussed other than just what went wrong. However, as
                            anyone with experience in running meetings knows, an agenda by itself will not keep a
                            meeting on track. A skilled facilitator is essential to ensure that the meeting's objectives
                            are achieved with or without a detailed agenda.<br>
                            B. The use of a skilled facilitator to guide the meeting<br>
                            Correct. A facilitator can help keep you, and everyone else, on track. Lessons learned
                            sessions don’t deliver any value when the discussion only focuses on what went wrong. A
                            facilitator can help guide the group to turn negatives into positives by eliciting what can
                            be done differently in the future and developing concrete actions to make sure the problems
                            do not recur on the project.<br>
                            C. Inviting more appropriate meeting participants<br>
                            Incorrect. There is no indication from the description provided by the question to indicate
                            that the wrong participants were in attendance. On the contrary, the fact that there was a
                            lengthy discussion about what has gone wrong on the project suggests that the meeting
                            participants are familiar with the issues raised at the meeting.<br>
                            D. An update to the lessons learned register after the meeting<br>
                            Incorrect. The lessons learned register should be updated with any knowledge gained that
                            might be beneficial in addressing the quality issues. However, the question states that the
                            meeting adjourned without any concrete actions to prevent the problems from occurring in the
                            future, leaving little or nothing to add to the lessons learned register.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            It may confuse to see a project in which the product is developed incrementally via
                            iterations while changes are processed via a change control board (CCB). Such a seemingly
                            weird combination of agile and traditional methods results in a hybrid project management
                            approach. It is possible that the organization is trying to gradually transition from the
                            traditional to the agile approach and incorporating some agile elements into a "well-oiled
                            waterfall machine." It is reasonable to assume that when such a transition takes place, not
                            everything goes right the first time. For example, in the scenario, the product owner
                            evaluates the technical change without consulting with the development team. Such an
                            approach goes against the best agile practices. While the backlog prioritization is the
                            ultimate responsibility of the product owner, it is the team who does the technical work
                            and, therefore, must be involved in such decisions. The team estimates the work and provides
                            information about technical dependencies. If the team is unable to develop a feature or
                            implement a change due to technical limitations, the product owner should be aware of this
                            and decide accordingly as to whether the change should be implemented and if yes, in which
                            iteration. For example, the team may decide that the implementation of the change requires
                            additional modifications to the product increment that should precede the change. This may
                            not be feasible within the timeframe of the current iteration. In such a case, the product
                            owner could have scheduled the change for a later iteration, thus preventing the problem
                            from happening in the first place or, at least, decreasing the chances of the failure.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Developed a risk response plan for the potential failure<br>
                            Incorrect. Developing a risk response plan for the potential failure would not worsen the
                            situation. However, it would not help it either, because risk responses are reactive in
                            nature. Implementing the risk response would not have prevented the problem from happening
                            in the first place.<br>
                            B. Consulted with the team about technical dependencies<br>
                            Correct. The scenario implies that the product development aspect of the project is managed
                            using agile methods. In such an environment, changes to the product are evaluated by both
                            the product owner and the team. The product owner decides on the priority after getting the
                            team's input on estimates and any technical dependencies the change may have.<br>
                            C. Approved the change without consulting with the CCB<br>
                            Incorrect. Based on how the scenario is framed, the CCB is assigned to the project,
                            inferring that all changes should go through the change control process established for the
                            project. Approving the change without consulting with the CCB would likely go against the
                            processes and procedures specified in the project management plan.<br>
                            D. Consulted with the project manager on other constraints<br>
                            Incorrect. While this action seems plausible for the project that uses a hybrid project
                            management approach, as implied from the scenario, the problem described refers to the
                            failure of the product increment. This suggests that a technical, rather than
                            administrative/managerial, issue was at the root of the problem. Therefore, consulting with
                            the project manager would have unlikely prevented the issue from happening.<br>

                          <div class="specificfeedback">Your answer is incorrect.<br>
                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            The question implies that the project charter is the document that is under development
                            since the project charter is the document issued by the project initiator or sponsor to
                            formally authorize the existence of a project. The question indicates that the execution of
                            the project requires the removal of asbestos insulation, which suggests that the project
                            needs to adhere to stringent safety standards for the handling of a known carcinogen.
                            Government and industry standards, which include safety standards, are enterprise
                            environmental factors, which may influence the creation of the project charter. The
                            incorrect answer choices contain details of the project, which are unlikely to be reflected
                            in the project charter. Therefore, in this scenario, the project charter will need to
                            incorporate compliance with any applicable government and industry standards.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. A contingency reserve needs to be assigned and recorded in the document<br>
                            Incorrect. The question suggests that the development of the project charter is currently
                            underway. Contingency reserves are established as part of the Project Cost Management
                            processes and not during the Develop Project Charter process. The project charter should
                            include a preliminary budget but not contingency reserves.<br>
                            B. The document needs to include a detailed risk response plan for this identified risk<br>
                            Incorrect. The question implies that the Develop Project Charter process is underway. The
                            project charter should include a summary of overall project risk but not detailed risk
                            response plans. Risk responses are not developed until the Plan Risk Responses process is
                            performed.<br>
                            C. The document needs to incorporate compliance with any applicable government and industry
                            standards<br>
                            Correct. Government and industry standards, which include safety standards, are enterprise
                            environmental factors, which may influence the creation of the project charter.<br>
                            D. A detailed timeline for the removal of the asbestos should be included in the
                            document<br>
                            Incorrect. The question describes the project charter as the document under development. The
                            project charter should include a summary milestone schedule but would not have a detailed
                            timeline for the removal of the asbestos.<br>

                          <div class="specificfeedback">Your answer is incorrect.<br>
                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            The question describes a situation where the project manager developed, implemented, and
                            enforced the team charter. The team charter works best when the team develops it or at least
                            has an opportunity to contribute to it. Additionally, all project team members share
                            responsibility for ensuring the rules documented in the team charter are followed. Of the
                            available options, allowing the project team to develop the team charter provides the best
                            way to avoid team conflict.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Have the human resources department provide a preapproved team charter<br>
                            Incorrect. Using a preapproved team charter suggests that it was not developed to address
                            the unique needs of a specific project team, and it is likely to be less effective as a
                            result.<br>
                            B. Allow the project team to develop the team charter<br>
                            Correct. The team charter works best when the team develops it or at least has an
                            opportunity to contribute to it. Additionally, all project team members share responsibility
                            for ensuring the rules documented in the team charter are followed.<br>
                            C. Conduct more frequent performance appraisals<br>
                            Incorrect. It is not known from the question how often performance appraisals are being
                            conducted. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if a gap exists in the frequency of
                            performance appraisals. Additionally, performance appraisals are a reactive measure and
                            unlikely to have prevented the conflict described by the question.<br>
                            D. Create a team member of the month award<br>
                            Incorrect. Incentives can influence team productivity but are unlikely to prevent team
                            conflict.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            Enterprise environmental factors (EEFs) are conditions, not under the control of the project
                            team, that influence, constrain, or direct the project. EEFs can be either internal or
                            external to the performing organization. Social and cultural influences and issues are
                            considered external EEFs. The political climate, codes of conduct, ethics, and perceptions
                            are examples of the social and cultural influences and issues. In the context of the Manage
                            Communications process described by the scenario, organizational culture, political climate,
                            and governance framework are among the EEFs that can influence this process. Therefore, the
                            political climate is the enterprise environmental factor that the project manager should
                            consider to ensure that communications are properly managed on her project.<br>
                            The incorrect answer choices are not considered EEFs.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Political climate<br>
                            Correct. The political climate is an enterprise environmental factor that falls under the
                            category of the social and cultural influences and issues. Political climate can influence
                            the way the communications are managed on a project.<br>
                            B. Active listening<br>
                            Incorrect. Active listening is an example of interpersonal and team skill. It is one of many
                            tools and techniques of Manage Communications, which is the process described in the
                            scenario. However, active listening is not an enterprise environmental factor.<br>
                            C. Risk report<br>
                            Incorrect. The risk report presents information on sources of overall project risk, together
                            with summary information on identified individual project risks. This information is
                            communicated to risk owners and other impacted stakeholders. While the risk report is an
                            input to the Manage Communications process implied by the scenario, the risk report is a
                            project document and not an enterprise environmental factor.<br>
                            D. Change log<br>
                            Incorrect. The change log is a comprehensive list of changes submitted during the project
                            and their current status. This document is used as an input to the Manage Communications
                            process suggested by the scenario to communicate changes to the stakeholders. However, the
                            question is asking to select the choice which represents an enterprise environmental factor
                            (EEF). The change log is a project document and not an EEF.<br>

                            The project benefits management plan is the document that describes how and when the
                            benefits of the project will be delivered. It also describes the mechanisms that should be
                            in place to measure those benefits. For example, on projects conducted using an agile
                            project management approach, the benefits could be realized as the project progresses. This
                            is possible because on agile projects, the product is typically developed incrementally and
                            is delivered with each consecutive iteration, thus providing value to the customer and a
                            revenue stream (realized benefits) to the organization. A properly prepared benefits
                            management plan describes the key elements of the benefits, including how well the project
                            benefits align with the business strategies of the organization. Among the available
                            choices, only the benefits management plan specifically addresses the concern raised by the
                            stakeholder.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Look at the benefits management plan<br>
                            Correct. A properly prepared benefits management plan describes the key elements of the
                            benefits including how well the project benefits align with the business strategies of the
                            organization.<br>
                            B. Review the assumption log<br>
                            Incorrect. The assumption log is a project document used to record all assumptions and
                            constraints throughout the project life cycle. The assumption log does not describe how the
                            project fits in with the company's overall organizational strategy.<br>
                            C. Examine the work breakdown structure<br>
                            Incorrect. The work breakdown structure (WBS) is a hierarchical decomposition of the total
                            scope of work to be executed by the project. Since the project is still new, it may not yet
                            have a WBS. Even if a WBS were to exist, it would not describe how the project fits in with
                            the company's overall organizational strategy.<br>
                            D. Ask the project sponsor<br>
                            Incorrect. The project sponsor is responsible for approving the project charter, securing
                            funding for the project, and supporting the project manager with issues beyond the project
                            manager's scope of authority. The project sponsor may have some information regarding the
                            project's alignment with organizational strategy, but there is a readily available document
                            which lists this information as a key element, which is a more appropriate source.<br>

                          <div class="specificfeedback">Your answer is incorrect.<br>
                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            The scenario implies the project is carried out using the predictive project management
                            approach. In such projects, the risk management plan specifies, among other things, the
                            timing of when and how often the Project Risk Management processes will be performed
                            throughout the project life cycle, and establishes risk management activities for inclusion
                            into the project schedule. According to the scenario, the team feels that conducting the
                            Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process once during project planning and then during
                            project execution, each time a major risk is identified, is not aligned with the iterative
                            nature of the product being developed. This implies that the product is likely being
                            developed in iterations suggesting an agile nature of the product development activities. In
                            an agile development environment, the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process is conducted
                            before the start of each iteration. This is done to address the inherent uncertainty and
                            risk typical for such environments. The predictive project management approach described in
                            the scenario and the incorporation of iterative development makes the project hybrid. In
                            hybrid settings, practices from various project management methods are often combined and
                            tailored to address the specific needs of the project. Therefore, of the choices provided,
                            conducting the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process before the start of each iteration
                            is the best answer to the question asked.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Instruct the project team to conduct Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis for minor risks
                            also<br>
                            Incorrect. The essence of the question lies with the risk management approach as it relates
                            to the iterative nature of the product rather than the severity of the risks. Therefore,
                            conducting the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis for minor risks also is unlikely to address
                            the problem raised by the team.<br>
                            B. Conduct the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process before the start of each
                            iteration<br>
                            Correct. The scenario implies the project could benefit from hybrid project management
                            methods. The iterative nature of the product being developed and the specifications in the
                            risk management plan imply that the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process can be more
                            efficient if conducted before the start of each iteration.<br>
                            C. Submit a change request to switch the nature of the product from iterative to
                            predictive<br>
                            Incorrect. It does not seem/sound reasonable that the nature of the product can be changed
                            at will be simply submitting a change request. This answer choice was intentionally designed
                            to make little to no sense.<br>
                            D. Proceed with the risk management approach as specified in the risk management plan<br>
                            Incorrect. The scenario states that the team is unsatisfied with the risk management
                            approach selected for the project. Proceeding with the same risk management approach as
                            specified in the risk management plan implies ignoring the team members' concerns. Ignoring
                            the team's concerns is unlikely to be a good way to move forward.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            The question describes the work required to create the risk register, which is an output of
                            the Identify Risks process. The risk register contains details of identified individual
                            project risks as well as potential risk owners and potential risk responses. Therefore, to
                            collect the information desired by the project manager the next logical step is to create
                            the risk register.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Create the risk register<br>
                            Correct. The risk register contains details of identified individual project risks as well
                            as potential risk owners and potential risk responses and is an output of the Identify Risks
                            process. Therefore, by creating the risk register, the project manager will have the desired
                            information.<br>
                            B. Develop the risk assignments report<br>
                            Incorrect. 'Risk assignments report' is a fake term made up for this question.<br>
                            C. Conduct the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process<br>
                            Incorrect. The risk register, which contains the information described in the scenario, is
                            needed to conduct the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process. Therefore, the risk
                            register is necessary before the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process is started.<br>
                            D. Conduct the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process<br>
                            Incorrect. The Identify Risks process which yields the information described in the
                            scenario, and the risk register, must be completed before starting the process of Perform
                            Qualitative Risk Analysis.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            The PMBOK® Guide defines the change control board (CCB) as "a formally chartered group
                            responsible for reviewing, evaluating, approving, deferring, or rejecting changes to the
                            project and for recording and communicating such decisions." Unless there is an individual
                            or a group that has the authority to overrule the CCB's decision (this information would
                            have been documented in the change management plan), the CCB has the final authority to
                            decide what, if any, changes can be made to the project deliverables. Based on the scenario
                            described, it can be reasonably assumed that the change has passed through all the necessary
                            steps, and the decision to reject has been made based on the best judgment of all involved
                            parties. Once the decision is made, all project work should abide by that decision. Trying
                            to persuade the CCB to revert their decision would not be the best use of time of the
                            project manager, the CCB members, or the stakeholder. Therefore, among the choices given,
                            re-communicating the decision of the CCB to the stakeholder and stating that the decision is
                            final would be the best course of action for the project manager to take in this situation
                            even though the project manager supports the change.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Instruct the designers to update the design<br>
                            Incorrect. The change control board did not approve the change. There is not enough
                            information in the question to determine if the project manager has the authority to
                            overrule the decision of the CCB, and it is unlikely that the project manager would have
                            this authority.<br>
                            B. Re-communicate the decision of the CCB to the project stakeholder and state that the
                            decision is final<br>
                            Correct. According to the scenario, the stakeholder who initiated the request is unhappy
                            with the CCB's decision implying the decision has already been communicated. However, of the
                            choices provided, re-communicating the decision and stating that the decision is final is
                            the best answer of the choices available.<br>
                            C. Tell the CCB they are making a big mistake and continue to support the stakeholder's
                            argument<br>
                            Incorrect. The project manager is a member of the CCB and would have already expressed
                            support for the change during the CCB meeting. However, based on the outcome of the meeting,
                            it can be inferred that the project manager was unsuccessful in persuading the CCB to
                            approve the change. Therefore, continuing arguing for the change is not the best use of the
                            project resources.<br>
                            D. Tell the stakeholder that they should present their case directly to the CCB<br>
                            Incorrect. Advising the stakeholder to go to the CCB would not be the best use of project
                            resources as the CCB's decision is final. Neither the project manager nor an individual
                            staffer should try persuading the CCB to change their decision that has been made based on
                            all available information and their best judgment.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            In the scenario, the project is in the Define Activities process where work packages are
                            decomposed into schedule activities that provide a basis for estimating, scheduling,
                            executing, monitoring and controlling project work. Decomposition, rolling wave planning,
                            and expert judgment are tools and techniques used in the Define Activities process. The
                            question is asking which of the answer choices is the 'least likely' to be performed during
                            the Define Activities process. Since all of the answer choices except leads and lags are
                            tools and techniques used in the Define Activities process, leads and lags is the correct
                            answer.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Decomposition<br>
                            Incorrect. In the scenario, the project is in the Define Activities process. Decomposition,
                            a tool and technique of the Define Activities process, is used for dividing and subdividing
                            deliverables into manageable parts. The question implies that the project team is using
                            decomposition to identify and document the activities required to produce the door panel.
                            Therefore, decomposition is an incorrect answer.<br>
                            B. Rolling wave planning<br>
                            Incorrect. Rolling wave planning is an iterative planning technique where work required in
                            the near-term is planned in detail, and future work is planned at a higher level. The
                            project is in the Define Activities process, and while rolling wave planning is not
                            explicitly mentioned in the scenario, it is a tool and technique that can be used in that
                            process. Since the question asks which option is 'least likely' to be performed in the
                            Define Activities process and rolling wave planning is a tool and technique of the process,
                            rolling wave planning is not the best answer to the question asked.<br>
                            C. Expert judgment<br>
                            Incorrect. Expert judgment is judgment provided by individuals or groups that have knowledge
                            and expertise in a subject matter. The scenario implies the project is in the Define
                            Activities process. Even though the scenario does not mention expert judgment explicitly, it
                            is a tool and technique of the Define Activities process, and 'could' be used as part of the
                            process. Therefore, expert judgment is not the correct answer.<br>
                            D. Leads and lags<br>
                            Correct. Leads and lags are a tool and technique used during the Sequence Activities process
                            to produce a project schedule network diagram. Since the scenario describes the project as
                            being in the Define Activities process, and leads and lags are used in the Sequence
                            Activities process, it is unlikely that leads and lags would be used. Therefore, leads and
                            lags is the correct answer.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            Directing and managing a project team in an agile environment often enables the project
                            manager to take a servant role and the project team to take more ownership and decision
                            making roles. Ideally, agile teams are comprised of generalized specialists, meaning the
                            team members are cross-functional who have both a focused specialty plus a breadth of
                            experience across multiple skills, instead of subject matter experts as often acceptable in
                            traditionally managed projects. As such, the project team can move as necessary between the
                            tasks and form self-organizing units freely and fluidly as the project demands. The project
                            manager takes a more supportive role and works to remove roadblocks and empower the
                            team.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. The team relies on the project manager's leadership and assignments.<br>
                            Incorrect. In agile projects where the team members are highly capable and knowledgeable,
                            the role of the project manager does not require them to direct and instruct the team
                            members. The team members are empowered to make their own choices and direction without a
                            need to rely on the project manager's leadership and assignments.<br>
                            B. The team is comprised of subject matter experts that have specific roles and skills.<br>
                            Incorrect. Teams comprised of specialists can primarily only perform the tasks they are
                            trained for. As such, this does not enable them to freely move between tasks and be
                            self-organizing.<br>
                            C. The team is comprised of generalists and able to support each other fluidly.<br>
                            Correct. Self-organizing teams are successful when the team members have broad skills and
                            understanding of the project activities enabling them to effectively move between tasks and
                            project needs.<br>
                            D. The team is larger than one project manager can put in one meeting room.<br>
                            Incorrect. The size of agile teams is typically small - around 6 to 10 members in most
                            circumstances. Nevertheless, the size of the room does not dictate or mandate the teams to
                            be self-organizing or not. The team's ability to be self-organizing is not based on physical
                            limitations.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            According to the scenario, the team is performing the Estimate Activity Resources process by
                            holding planning meetings to determine resource needs for the project. Project team
                            assignments, however, are a key output of the Acquire Resources process which is carried out
                            later in the project life cycle, as part of project execution. Project team assignments is a
                            project document that records the team members and their roles and responsibilities for the
                            project. Recording this information can only be done after the team is acquired. Since the
                            project is still in planning, and no information is provided in the scenario as to whether
                            or not pre-assignment took place earlier in the project, it can be assumed that the project
                            team assignments document cannot be created at this point, making it the least likely
                            outcome of the planning meetings described in the scenario. All of the other answer choices
                            are key outputs of the Estimate Activity Resources process and can, therefore, be
                            eliminated.<br>
                            If you have selected an incorrect answer, this could be because you may have missed the word
                            'least' in the last sentence of the question. This could be a frustrating experience.
                            However, it is important to understand that these types of questions may appear on the
                            actual exam. Therefore, carefully reading the question text is an important part of
                            practicing and preparing for the exam.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Resource requirements<br>
                            Incorrect. The project manager is performing the Estimate Activity Resources process by
                            holding planning meetings to determine the resources needed for the project. Resource
                            requirements are one of the outputs of the Estimate Activity Resources process.<br>
                            B. Project team assignments<br>
                            Correct. The team is performing the Estimate Activity Resources process by holding planning
                            meetings to determine the resources needed for the project. Project team assignments,
                            however, are a key output of the Acquire Resources process. The project team would have to
                            acquire the team members first, then they could record the team members and their roles and
                            responsibilities for the project.<br>
                            C. Basis of estimates<br>
                            Incorrect. The scenario implies that the Estimate Activity Resources process is carried out.
                            Basis of estimates is one of the outputs of this process.<br>
                            D. Resource breakdown structure<br>
                            Incorrect. According to the scenario, the project manager is performing the Estimate
                            Activity Resources process by holding planning meetings to determine the resources needed
                            for the project. The resource breakdown structure is one of the outputs of this process.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            Activity attributes is a project document containing the resource requirements for a
                            particular activity. The activity attributes for activity 6.5.3 would indicate what
                            credentials, if any, are required to install the cooling mechanism. The resource
                            requirements project document would also be a good answer, but since resource requirements
                            are not provided as a choice, "activity attributes" is the best answer to the question
                            asked.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Resource calendar<br>
                            Incorrect. The resource calendar is a project document that provides information on resource
                            availability, but not resource assignments.<br>
                            B. Resource management plan<br>
                            Incorrect. The resource management plan is not a project document. It is a component of the
                            project management plan that outlines the approach to acquiring, allocating, monitoring, and
                            controlling resources. While the plan may have some information about the project roles and
                            responsibilities, it does not specify resources down to the activity level.<br>
                            C. Activity attributes<br>
                            Correct. Activity attributes is a project document that expands the description of the
                            activity by identifying many aspects of the activity, including resource requirements,
                            predecessor and successor activities, logical relationships, lead and lags, etc.<br>
                            D. Procurement management plan<br>
                            Incorrect. Although a refrigeration specialist may be an outside resource acquired as part
                            of procurement management, the procurement management plan would not indicate resource
                            assignments.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            It is reasonable to assume that the scenario describes the Monitor Risks process. Reserve
                            analysis is an example of the data analysis technique that can be used in this process.
                            Reserve analysis compares the amount of the contingency reserves remaining to the amount of
                            risk remaining at any time in the project in order to determine if the remaining reserve is
                            adequate. The question states that the ground security risk has been identified during
                            project planning implying the response was planned for this risk including security fund
                            allocation. The project manager would need to find out if the security risk response plan
                            included enough funds that would cover the additional fencing. This determination can be
                            made by performing a reserve analysis, making a reserve analysis the best answer, of the
                            available choices, to the question asked.<br>

                            A. Technical performance analysis<br>
                            Incorrect. Technical performance analysis compares technical accomplishments during project
                            execution to the schedule of technical achievement. Technical performance analysis is not
                            used to determine if the project has enough funds to cover any particular risk.<br>
                            B. Reserve analysis<br>
                            Correct. Reserve analysis compares the amount of the contingency reserves remaining to the
                            amount of risk remaining at any time in the project to determine if the remaining reserve is
                            adequate. In the scenario, the project manager should use reserve analysis to determine if
                            the extra fencing can be covered with the reserve security funds.<br>
                            C. Contingency analysis<br>
                            Incorrect. 'Contingency analysis' is a made-up term.<br>
                            D. Risk audit<br>
                            Incorrect. Risk audits are a type of audit that may be used to consider the effectiveness of
                            the risk management process. A risk audit is not a data analysis technique and, therefore,
                            an incorrect answer choice.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            The project phase is being closed out, and there should not be these types of disconnects.
                            The question suggests that the project manager did not set proper expectations with the
                            customer on maintaining deliverables. The rules on who maintains deliverables, and when the
                            project team transfers such responsibility, should be clearly called out in the statement of
                            work (SOW) or contract. It is the project manager’s responsibility to ensure these
                            conditions are clearly understood. The incorrect options suggest specific potential
                            arrangements on who is responsible and when for maintaining the deliverables, but the
                            question did not state a specific arrangement. The arrangement is project-specific and
                            dependent on what is set out in the contract or SOW.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Customers need to maintain all deliverables after they are accepted<br>
                            Incorrect. In general, customers do not maintain deliverables until they are fully accepted
                            and transferred. There is not enough information in the scenario to determine if the
                            deliverables have been accepted by the customer. The scenario is talking about a project
                            that is 'moving' toward the end of its first phase with 'intermediate deliverables' implying
                            the phase has not yet been completed and the deliverables have not yet been accepted.<br>
                            B. The customer is correct since project teams maintain all deliverables until the project
                            is complete<br>
                            Incorrect. The maintenance rules should be clearly called out in the statement of work (SOW)
                            or contract. The scenario does not mention a condition that the project teams must maintain
                            all deliverables until the project is complete.<br>
                            C. The project manager did not set proper expectations with the customer on maintaining
                            deliverables<br>
                            Correct. The rules on who will maintain deliverables and when should be called out in the
                            statement of work (SOW) or contract. It is the project manager’s responsibility to ensure
                            these conditions are clearly understood.<br>
                            D. The project manager is right, once a phase closes, all deliverables are maintained by the
                            customer<br>
                            Incorrect. The scenario does not mention a condition that all deliverables are maintained by
                            the customer once a phase closes. The arrangement is project-specific and should follow what
                            is stated in the contract or statement of work (SOW).<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            The question implies that the Plan Resource Management process is underway. Data
                            representation techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to
                            charts. In this scenario, a RACI chart quickly and efficiently identifies which team member
                            or stakeholder is responsible or accountable for project activities and who should be
                            consulted or informed about project work.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Create a framework to help the team restrain, ascertain, constrain, and explain project
                            roles.<br>
                            Incorrect. These are made-up terms.<br>
                            B. Determine who is responsible, who is accountable, who should be consulted, and who simply
                            needs to be informed about project activities.<br>
                            A RACI chart is a type of responsibility assignment matrix. This document will clearly
                            outline team roles and assignments to activities, so there is no confusion about who is in
                            charge of which project activities.<br>
                            C. Let the team naturally decide who does what.<br>
                            Incorrect. As the project manager, you are in charge of deciding the various roles for the
                            team members and the project activities to which that are assigned.<br>
                            D. The team should rate, allocate, correlate, and integrate project activities.<br>
                            Incorrect. These are made-up terms. The project manager is responsible for project
                            assignments.<br>

                          <div class="specificfeedback">Your answer is incorrect.<br>
                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            The question is asking where to find information on lessons learned from past project
                            kick-off meetings. The lessons learned repository is an organizational process asset which
                            serves as a store of historical information about lessons learned from previous projects.
                            This information would have been collected at the end of the kick-off meeting or shortly
                            afterward, making it the most accurate and relevant. Therefore, of the choices given,
                            researching the organizational process assets is the best answer to the question asked.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Review the lessons learned register<br>
                            Incorrect. The lessons learned register is a source for information on the current project.
                            However, information on past projects is contained in the lessons learned repository rather
                            than the lessons learned register.<br>
                            B. Meet with participants of past kick-off meetings<br>
                            Incorrect. While kick-off meeting participants from past projects may have some relevant
                            information, first, it is unclear if they are still with the company and are available;
                            second, if they are, meeting with all or even some of them may be unrealistic or not the
                            best use of your time; and, third, memory fades quickly, so it is likely that they may not
                            recall the precise details of the meetings they attended in the past. Checking the
                            organizational process assets is a better answer choice because the lessons learned
                            repository is more likely to have complete and accurate information collected from the
                            relevant participants shortly after the kick-off meetings took place.<br>
                            C. Check the enterprise environmental factors for information from past projects<br>
                            Incorrect. Information from past project kick-off meetings which at the time those projects
                            took place was considered helpful for the future projects is likely to be documented in the
                            lessons learned repository. The lessons learned repository is an organizational process
                            asset and not an enterprise environmental factor.<br>
                            D. Research the organizational process assets<br>
                            Correct. Information that was considered helpful when past projects were underway was likely
                            to be recorded in the lessons learned register of those projects and later on transferred to
                            the lessons learned repository which is an organizational process asset. Therefore,
                            researching the organizational process assets to obtain any relevant information from the
                            past kick-off meetings is your best course of action to ensure the best possible outcome for
                            the kick-off meeting of your current project.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            The question suggests that the project manager is performing the Develop Team process and
                            needs to gain an understanding of how and when to provide training to the team which will be
                            required for the upcoming phases. The project schedule serves as an input to the Develop
                            Team process and presents linked activities with planned dates, durations, milestones, and
                            resources. Note, the project schedule alone does not define 'what' training is needed for a
                            particular team member and 'how' this training should be conducted. However, by analyzing
                            the project schedule and identifying what activities are scheduled, when they are scheduled,
                            and who is assigned to these activities, the project manager can determine in advance what
                            training is required for each project team member, and how this training should be conducted
                            to develop the competencies required at different phases. In other words, the project
                            schedule helps identify the need for team development strategies during project execution.
                            Therefore, of the available choices, checking the project schedule is the best answer to the
                            question asked.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Consult the project schedule<br>
                            Correct. The project schedule is an output of a schedule model that presents linked
                            activities with planned dates, durations, milestones, and resources. The project schedule
                            defines how and when to provide training to the project team and develop the competencies
                            required at different phases.<br>
                            B. . Talk to the human resources department<br>
                            Incorrect. While the human resources department may have a general idea about training, it
                            is unlikely that they would have information on specific training required for the team
                            members of every project undertaken by the performing organization.<br>
                            CReview the resource calendars<br>
                            Incorrect. A resource calendar is a calendar that identifies the working days and shifts
                            upon which each specific resource is available. While the resource calendars may help
                            determine team and resource availability for scheduling team development activities, the
                            resource calendar does not provide guidance on how and when to provide training, nor does it
                            help to understand 'what' training is needed since the information about the assigned tasks
                            is not included in the resource calendar.<br>
                            D. Examine the training management plan<br>
                            Incorrect. 'Training management plan' is a made-up term.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            The question describes a situation where you, as the project manager, are relying
                            exclusively on management to keep the project on track. The consequence of this leadership
                            style is that the project team lacks the autonomy to perform optimally. Developing
                            leadership skills and focusing more on the horizon will inspire trust and improve the
                            performance of the team. All the incorrect answer choices are related to emphasizing
                            management over leadership, which will be counterproductive in this situation. Therefore, of
                            the available options, developing leadership skills to inspire trust and focusing more on
                            the horizon is the best approach to improve team performance.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Become a more inspirational leader by improving your management skills<br>
                            Incorrect. The question describes a situation where you, as a project manager, are
                            emphasizing management over leadership. You need to improve your leadership skills rather
                            than management skills.<br>
                            B. Ask the project team to focus more on systems and structure<br>
                            Incorrect. A focus on systems and structure is an example of management over leadership. To
                            inspire trust, you, as the project manager, should emphasize leadership, which should

                            C. Develop leadership skills to inspire trust and focus more on the horizon<br>
                            Correct. Developing leadership skills and focusing more on the horizon inspires trust and
                            helps to enhance the performance of the team.<br>
                            D. Focus your attention more on operational issues and problem-solving<br>
                            Incorrect. The problem described by the question is that you, as the project manager, are
                            relying exclusively on management rather than leadership to keep the project on track.
                            Focusing on operational issues and problem-solving is an example of management over
                            leadership.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            Conflict is inevitable in a project environment. Learning how to manage conflict is a
                            valuable interpersonal skill for a project manager. Each technique has its place and use.
                            Retreating from an actual or potential conflict situation and postponing the issue to be
                            better prepared or to be resolved by others is the technique of withdrawing/avoiding. The
                            project manager left the supervisor's office in the midst of the conflict clearly
                            withdrawing from the conflict.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Smoothing/accommodating<br>
                            Incorrect. Using a smoothing/accommodating resolution technique involves conceding one's
                            position to the needs of others to maintain harmony and relationships. In the scenario
                            described, neither the project manager nor the supervisor has conceded their positions, and
                            clearly, a harmonious resolution has not been obtained.<br>
                            B. Compromising<br>
                            Incorrect. Compromising is searching for solutions that bring some degree of satisfaction to
                            all parties to temporarily or partially resolve the conflict. The interaction between the
                            two parties did not lead to any type of resolution, temporary or not.<br>
                            C. Withdrawing/avoiding<br>
                            Correct. The project manager left the supervisor's office and the conflict behind thereby
                            withdrawing and avoiding the situation.<br>
                            D. Collaborating<br>
                            Incorrect. Incorporating multiple viewpoints and insights from differing perspectives
                            typically leading to a resolution by consensus is the definition of collaborating. There was
                            no resolution in this scenario making this an incorrect answer.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            Some organizations assign a team or individual as a specialist in knowledge management. A
                            centralized person or group responsible for knowledge management may allow the company to
                            keep track of who in the organization has critical skills that can help on other projects as
                            well as coordinate those activities. Video conferencing and face-to-face meetings may help
                            identify those people and skills but would not address the long-term needs. A common change
                            control process has little or no relevance to knowledge management. Therefore, of the
                            available responses, having a centralized person responsible for knowledge management is the
                            best answer to the question asked.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. A common change control process<br>
                            Incorrect. A common change control process may help to address uniformity and communication
                            of changes, but it cannot act as a repository for the company’s knowledge sources and track
                            who in the company possesses specific knowledge and experience.<br>
                            B. A video conferencing system<br>
                            Incorrect. A video conferencing system may be used to identify those in the company with
                            specific knowledge and experience, but it cannot act as a repository for corporate knowledge
                            sources and track who in the company possesses specific knowledge and experience.<br>
                            C. Monthly face-to-face meetings<br>
                            Incorrect. Monthly face-to-face meetings may be used to get to know the team or employee’s
                            capabilities better, but it cannot act as a repository for corporate knowledge sources and
                            track who in the company possesses specific knowledge and experience.<br>
                            D. A centralized person responsible for knowledge management<br>
                            Correct. As the organization is looking for a solution across multiple projects spanning
                            many geographic regions, a centralized person or group being responsible for knowledge
                            management may be a viable solution.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            Being self-organizing, self-directing, and empowered, are among the main characteristics of
                            high-performing agile teams. However, being self-organizing, self-directing, and empowered
                            does not guarantee that the team would be able to successfully complete the project without
                            team members who possess specific technical knowledge. Agile advocates for team members to
                            become generalizing specialists in order to reduce team size, overcome bottlenecks, and
                            create high performing cross-functional teams. Cross-functional means the team is no longer
                            made up solely of subject matter experts, but instead, of generalizing specialists able to
                            perform any task. Although becoming cross-functional team may take time, of the options
                            presented, this characteristic is the best answer to the question asked.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Self-organizing<br>
                            Incorrect. Agile teams are self-organizing or self-managing. However, self-organization will
                            not, in and of itself, provide the unique technical and/or project skills that have been
                            lost in the scenario described. Another characteristic better addresses the question
                            asked.<br>
                            B. Empowered<br>
                            Incorrect. Although agile teams are empowered to make local decisions about work items,
                            replacing the specific technical skills which have been lost will require the team members
                            to become generalizing specialists, which is not directly related to empowerment.<br>
                            C. Self-directing<br>
                            Incorrect. Agile approaches encourage and make use of self-directing or self-managing teams
                            to make local decisions about work items, such as task sequencing and which approach to use
                            when solving a problem. However, being a self-directed team does not directly replace the
                            specific project skills which have been lost in the scenario described.<br>
                            D. Cross-functional<br>
                            Correct. The team has to become cross-functional to complete the project successfully. A
                            cross-functional team means the team is no longer made up solely of subject matter experts,
                            but instead, of generalizing specialists able to perform any task, whether it's developing
                            software code, test, integrate, etc.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            The team charter is a document that records the team values, agreements, and operating
                            guidelines, as well as establish clear expectations regarding acceptable behavior by project
                            team members. A team charter can be used regardless of the project management methodology.
                            However, the project charter should be customized for the particular team, project, and
                            project management framework. The elements of the team charter will likely be influenced by
                            the project management framework.<br>
                            Scrum: Scrum is a popular agile framework that includes various ceremonies, including a
                            sprint review. This ceremony is typically attended by all team members who demonstrate the
                            product increment developed so far to the relevant project stakeholders.<br>
                            Predictive: A Gantt chart is a bar chart of schedule information where activities are listed
                            on the vertical axis, dates are shown on the horizontal axis, and activity durations are
                            shown as horizontal bars placed according to start and finish dates. Gantt charts are
                            typically used for predictive projects where the project tasks and durations can be
                            determined during initial project planning. Team members can check the Gantt chart daily to
                            see their assigned tasks.<br>
                            Hybrid: A hybrid framework typically incorporates elements of predictive and agile
                            methodologies. In this case, a self-organizing team is indicative of agile and a resource
                            management plan is associated with predictive project management. A project that
                            incorporates agile practices within an overarching project management plan is an example of
                            a hybrid project.<br>
                            SAFe®: The Scaled Agile Framework is among the scaling frameworks of agile. Scaling
                            frameworks typically employ the practice of using a Scrum of Scrums (SoS) to facilitate
                            communication and coordination between related project teams.<br>
                            XP: eXtreme Programming is an agile methodology that is known for the use of pair
                            programming and commonly used for software development. With pair programming, developers
                            work in pairs with one writing the code and the other reviewing the code as it is
                            entered.<br>

                          <div class="specificfeedback">Your answer is incorrect.<br>
                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            The scenario describes a project with an approved project management plan that incorporates
                            an iterative approach with constraint-driven delivery. Therefore, this project is a hybrid
                            project that includes elements of predictive and agile frameworks. Dynamic Systems
                            Development Method (DSDM) is known for the constraint-driven delivery approach. With
                            constraint-driven delivery, the budget and release date would be fixed, whereas the scope is
                            variable. With the project team's velocity exceeding expectations, the team should be able
                            to deliver more features to be included in the release, but the release date should not be
                            changed.<br>
                            Additionally, since the project has an approved project management plan, it is reasonable to
                            assume that the release date is incorporated into the schedule baseline, which is part of
                            the project management plan. An approved change request would be required to update the
                            schedule baseline. Change requests are handled in accordance with the change management
                            plan. There is not enough information in the scenario to determine if the project manager
                            alone has the authority to approve change requests. Therefore, adjusting the release date is
                            the 'least' likely decision to be delegated to the project team.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Moving up the release date in response to the accelerated delivery of features<br>
                            Correct. With constraint-driven delivery, the budget and release date would be fixed,
                            whereas the scope is variable. If velocity is higher than planned, then the project team
                            should be able to deliver more features for inclusion in the release rather than moving up
                            the release date.<br>
                            B. Adjusting the project schedule with the tasks assigned to the team<br>
                            Incorrect. The project schedule is a project document, and, unlike the schedule baseline,
                            does not require an approved change request to be updated. Although the project schedule is
                            typically maintained by the project manager, it is possible for the project manager to
                            delegate this responsibility to project team members.<br>
                            C. Determining how many features will be developed by the release date<br>
                            Incorrect. When using constraint-driven delivery, the time and cost are fixed, whereas the
                            scope is variable. The project team will continue to develop features, which are pulled from
                            a prioritized backlog until the time or cost constraint has been reached.<br>
                            D. Deciding the number of story points for inclusion in each iteration<br>
                            Incorrect. When using an iterative approach to product development, the project team
                            typically determines how much work can be completed during the iteration. The project

                            Explanation: <br>
                            The project manager should ask the stakeholder to discuss the new requirement with the
                            product owner and let them decide whether to include it in the product backlog. This is an
                            example of reciprocal commitment, where the agile development team commits to delivering
                            100% of the specified functionality according to the definition of done at the end of the
                            sprint, and the product owner, organization, and customer agree not to add new user stories
                            (requirements) or change priorities during the sprint. Additionally, according to the
                            scenario, the project change management plan provides that all changes should pass through
                            the change control board (CCB). This is an example of a hybrid project where some aspects
                            are managed using agile while others using the predictive project management approach.<br>
                            Note, reciprocal commitment is an important agile principle. However, it is by no means
                            absolute. This situation may occur in real-life situations. For example, it could be that
                            this new requirement will be considered of higher value to the customer and/or higher risk
                            to the project by the product owner. If so, the product owner has several choices:<br>
                            The product owner may decide to add the new requirement as a user story in the current
                            sprint backlog. However, this change to the current sprint backlog should not be made
                            without the approval of the development team and the removal of an equivalent amount of work
                            from the current sprint backlog.<br>
                            The product owner may also decide to create a user story for this requirement and add it to
                            the top of the product backlog, i.e., give it the highest priority for the inclusion into
                            the next sprint.<br>
                            Another option is that if the requirement has significant business or technological
                            implications (such as a compliance issue), the product owner may decide to cancel the
                            current sprint and start a new sprint that includes this new high priority requirement.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Reprioritize the backlog of the current sprint and instruct the project team to develop
                            the new must-have requirement<br>
                            Incorrect. It's the product (not sprint) backlog that should be re-prioritized. And, it's
                            the product owner (not the project manager) who should do the re-prioritization.
                            Additionally, since all changes should go via the CCB, as stated in the scenario, a change
                            request will have to be submitted.<br>
                            B. Reject the requirement since new requirements can be requested only by the product owner
                            and change control board<br>
                            Incorrect. According to the scenario, the deliverables are developed using sprints, implying
                            the actual work is carried out using agile practices. While it's true than on agile
                            projects, the product owner is typically the one who defines the scope; there is nothing
                            wrong if a project stakeholder requests a change or new requirement. The scenario mentions
                            CCB as the entity to review and approve changes. The scenario, however, does not suggest
                            that new requirements can only be submitted by the product owner and/or CCB.<br>
                            C. Hold a sprint retrospective to determine why the requirement was not identified during
                            the Collect Requirements process<br>
                            Incorrect. First, a retrospective is held at the end of the sprint to inspect and adapt the
                            process the team uses to develop product increments, rather than identify reasons why
                            requirements were not identified. Second, not all requirements are typically identified
                            during the Collect Requirements process. Some pop up as the project progresses. This is why
                            there are processes and procedures in place (as per the project management approach
                            selected) to manage changes to the project during its execution.<br>
                            D. Ask the stakeholder to discuss the new requirement with the product owner and have them
                            submit a change request<br>
                            Correct. The product owner is the individual who is responsible for the content and
                            prioritization of the product backlog. New requirements should be discussed with the product
                            owner, who will decide whether to include the requirements in the product backlog.
                            Additionally, since all changes should go via the change control board, as stated in the
                            scenario, a change request will have to be submitted.<br>

                          <div class="specificfeedback">Your answer is incorrect.<br>
                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            The schedule variance (SV) can be calculated as the earned value (EV) minus the planned
                            value (PV). The current total earned value can be obtained by multiplying each activity's
                            planned value by its percentage complete and adding them together. Therefore, the current
                            total earned value is $52,500. The current total planned value is the sum of the planned
                            values of the activities that should have been completed according to the approved plan,
                            which is this scenario is $65,000. Note, since the scenario mentions that the method used to
                            determine the earned value is based on percent complete, the earned value of a partially
                            completed work package is calculated by multiplying the planned value of the work package by
                            its percent complete.<br>
                            The following are the correct calculations for the schedule variance:<br>
                            SV = EV - PV<br>
                            EV = ($5,000 x 100%) + ($10,000 x 100%) + ($50,000 x 75%) = $52,500<br>
                            PV = $5,000 + $10,000 + $50,000 = $65,000<br>
                            SV = $52,500 - $65,000 = -$12,500<br>
                            Therefore, the schedule variance (SV) is -$12,500. Since the SV is a negative value, in this
                            case, the project is running behind schedule.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. The schedule variance is -$12,500, and the project performance is unknown<br>
                            Incorrect. While the schedule variance is indeed -$12,500, the project performance 'can' be
                            determined using various earned value measurement techniques. For example, when the schedule
                            variance is negative, such as in this scenario, the project is behind schedule.<br>
                            B. The schedule variance is -$12,500, and the project is running behind schedule<br>
                            Correct. The schedule variance (SV) can be calculated as the earned value (EV) minus the
                            planned value (PV) or SV = EV - PV. The EV is calculated as EV = ($5,000 x 100%) + ($10,000
                            x 100%) + ($50,000 x 75%) = $52,500. The PV is calculated as PV = $5,000 + $10,000 + $50,000
                            = $65,000. Therefore, SV = $52,500 - $65,000 = -$12,500. Since the SV is a negative value,
                            the project is running behind schedule.<br>
                            C. The schedule variance is -$12,500, and the project is running ahead of schedule<br>
                            Incorrect. The schedule variance is -$12,500. Negative schedule variance means the project
                            is behind, not ahead of, schedule.<br>
                            D. The schedule variance is $12,500, and the project is running behind schedule<br>
                            Incorrect. While the project is indeed running behind schedule, the first part of this
                            answer choice represents incorrect usage of the formula for the schedule variance where EV
                            and PV are transposed.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            Conducting procurements for the project requires information and consultation from different
                            sources. A high-level preliminary technical evaluation was conducted for this procurement
                            need, but on its own, it does not provide a complete picture of a potential sellers' ability
                            to fulfill the procurement needs. Additional evaluation is needed to assess a vendor's
                            non-technical capabilities. The procurement manager essentially conducted such an
                            evaluation, which as it turned out, was even documented in the procurement management plan.
                            Given the choices presented, moving forward with the procurement manager's expert judgment
                            is the best option for the project manager in this situation.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Follow the expert judgment of the procurement manager<br>
                            Correct. Technically - solely based on the high-level technical evaluation conducted -
                            vendor X rated higher, but the project manager must consider the additional information and
                            the advice of the procurement manager.<br>
                            B. Select vendor Z to avoid conflict of interest<br>
                            Incorrect. Vendor Z was determined not to be the best vendor choice from a technical aspect
                            and procurement aspect. There is nothing in the question that suggests a conflict of
                            interest with vendor Z.<br>
                            C. Hold a bidder conference with vendors X and Y<br>
                            Incorrect. A bidder conference is held prior to the bids to communicate the needs of a bid
                            to potential sellers. Such a meeting does not help in this situation.<br>
                            D. Select vendor X based on technical criteria<br>
                            Incorrect. Technical evaluations are important, but they do not provide the complete picture
                            of a vendor's ability to deliver and be a reliable supplier. It is important for the project
                            manager to assess the technical criteria along with other evaluation criteria.<br>

                          <div class="specificfeedback">Your answer is incorrect.<br>
                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            This question is slightly tricky, as it takes the concepts of knowledge management that you
                            need in your project and extends it to the product of the project, which also requires
                            knowledge management. In other words, the objective of the project is to build a website
                            used to manage knowledge. The overarching issue in any knowledge management solution
                            (physical or electronic) is the segregation of information based on the need to know and
                            legal restrictions. Therefore, confidentiality will be a major concern with the website
                            under development. Although there may be requirements for handling peak loads that could be
                            caused by flu outbreaks and other requirements for the system, these other requirements are
                            not critical to the system design. Therefore, ensuring the confidentiality of personal data
                            will be the highest priority.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Prevalence of flu outbreaks<br>
                            Incorrect. Flu outbreaks may increase the number of users on the system, simulating a system
                            load test. But a load test based on the volume of potential users during a flu outbreak
                            would create is a secondary concern to another more essential part of the system.<br>
                            B. Parents' knowledge of problems that exist in their families<br>
                            Incorrect. The system design isn't dependent on the knowledge that the families possess. The
                            system is being created to help fill in gaps in parent's knowledge, so discoveries or trends
                            can be identified. Therefore, a parent’s knowledge of problems that exist is not a major
                            influencer of system design, but this knowledge is exactly the type of data that would
                            populate the system, once built.<br>
                            C. Confidentiality of personal data<br>
                            Correct. This system will contain personal data that needs to be protected. Just like a
                            project knowledge management system, confidential data on a system such as described in this
                            scenario must be protected.<br>
                            D. User interface requirements<br>
                            Incorrect. Although user interface requirements are very important, ensuring the
                            confidentiality of the electronic data in the system is the highest priority system design
                            concern. Thus, although this choice presents a valid answer, it is not the 'best'
                            answer.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            The project kick-off meeting is usually associated with the end of planning and the start of
                            executing. Its purpose is to communicate the objectives of the project, gain commitment of
                            the team for the project, and explain the roles and responsibilities of each stakeholder.
                            Conducting the kick-off meeting, communicating the start of the project, key milestones, and
                            other relevant information would inform and engage the team and stakeholders and gain their
                            commitment for the project.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Email the project management plan to the team and stakeholders<br>
                            Incorrect. While emailing the project management plan can be one of the steps to share the
                            pan, this action would not provide the benefit of interactive communication. Interactive
                            communication is a more effective method of gaining the commitment of stakeholders allowing
                            them to ask questions and have their concerns addressed in real-time.<br>
                            B. Publish the project management plan on the company website<br>
                            Incorrect. There is nothing wrong with publishing the project management plan on the company
                            website. However, this action would unlikely to accomplish one of the objectives requested
                            by the scenario, i.e., gaining commitment, nor will it allow two-way communication between
                            the project manager and stakeholders.<br>
                            C. Conduct a kick-off meeting with the project team and stakeholders<br>
                            Correct. Conducting a kick-off meeting, communicating the start of the project, key
                            milestones, and other relevant information would allow the project manager to inform and
                            engage the project team and stakeholders and gain their commitment.<br>
                            D. Delegate the responsibility to one of the project team members<br>
                            Incorrect. While it's true that a project manager does not have to perform all tasks by
                            him-/herself, not every task can be delegated. Communicating the start of project execution
                            to inform stakeholders and gain commitment is one of the most important project tasks and
                            should be performed by the project manager rather than one of the team members.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            The scenario indicates that the project team is using agile elements, such as a product
                            backlog. However, local data privacy laws represent fixed requirements that follow a more
                            predictive project management approach, implying the project as a whole is managed using a
                            hybrid model. A phase gate is typically used on projects managed traditionally. A phase gate
                            is a review at the end of a phase in which a decision is made to continue to the next phase,
                            to continue with modification, or to end a project. The introduction of the phase gate
                            provides the company with the possibility to evaluate the results of the cost analysis and
                            decide on whether to pay penalties for being incompliant with the local data privacy laws or
                            rework some of the product components to comply with the laws.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Refactoring<br>
                            Incorrect. Refactoring is a product quality technique introduced by eXtreme Programming
                            (XP). Refactoring is used to reduce technical debt by restructuring an existing software
                            code without changing its external behavior. Although refactoring is a good practice for
                            development teams to adhere to, it is not the technique of choice to control project costs
                            when facing compliance issues.<br>
                            B. Personas<br>
                            Incorrect. Personas characterize typical types of users of a product fictitiously. While
                            personas can help develop features according to actual end-user needs, they are not the most
                            suitable tool for controlling project costs.<br>
                            C. A phase gate<br>
                            Correct. According to the scenario, the team is using some agile elements, such as the
                            product backlog. However, the regulatory compliance issues and budget constraints call for
                            the integration of more predictive techniques, such as a phase gate. In this situation, the
                            phase gate can be used to decide on whether to pay penalties for not being compliant with
                            data privacy laws or modify the product to be compliant.<br>
                            D. Fast tracking<br>
                            Incorrect. Fast tracking is a schedule compression technique in which activities or phases
                            that are normally done in sequence are performed in parallel for at least a portion of their
                            duration. Fast tracking may be useful when facing time constraints; however, it is not
                            likely to help with solving compliance issues under a tight budget.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            The ultimate goal of any team is to move up the team development ladder to the performing
                            stage and become a high-performing team. High-performing teams are characterized by
                            constructive disagreement, which is achieved with healthy levels of conflict. In the
                            scenario presented, the team members work independently and avoid conflict. Teams in the
                            forming stages of development are characterized by a lack of trust and fear of conflict.
                            Agile leaders can help their teams avoid the fear of conflict by explaining that not all
                            conflict is bad. Trust is built by addressing and working through the conflict as a team.
                            Conflict must not be avoided. Rather, if the conflict arises, the issue at hand should be
                            discussed and dealt with, which would help the team to form and move onto the next stage of
                            development.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Storming; the scrum master needs to help the team navigate the conflict towards high
                            performance.<br>
                            Incorrect. The storming stage of team development is characterized by high levels of
                            conflict. In the situation described in the question, the team members are avoiding
                            conflict, making this choice an incorrect answer.<br>
                            B. Norming; the scrum master needs to help the team put conflict aside as unhealthy and
                            nonproductive.<br>
                            Incorrect. In the norming stage of team development, the team members learn to trust each
                            other. Conflicts exist among the team members, and often the team may need help from their
                            leaders with conflict resolution. In the situation described in the question, the team
                            members are avoiding conflict. What also makes this choice an incorrect answer is a notion
                            that conflict is seen as unhealthy and nonproductive, which is the opposite of how agile
                            approaches this.<br>
                            C. Performing; the scrum master needs to ensure conflict is mitigated to keep the team
                            members on task.<br>
                            Incorrect. The performing stage of team development is characterized by a relatively low
                            level of conflict, but a high level of trust. In the situation described in the question,
                            the team members work independently and do not seem to trust each other. Conflict in agile
                            should not be mitigated unless it reaches unreasonable levels.<br>
                            D. Forming; the scrum master needs to help the team acknowledge that conflict is productive
                            and necessary.<br>
                            Correct. The forming stage of team development is characterized by a low level of trust and
                            conflict avoidance among the team members. Agile leaders should help the team members build
                            trust and understand that conflict is a positive thing that stimulates constructive
                            disagreement and a healthy decision-making process.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            The scenario indicates that an agile project phase is operating within an overarching
                            predictive framework, which results in a hybrid project. Physical colocation provides
                            benefits in improved communication and collaboration. In this scenario, the project was
                            planned to take advantage of the benefits of a co-located project team. However, unforeseen
                            and extreme circumstances now prevent the project team from being physically co-located.
                            Therefore, the best course of action is to organize the team members as a virtual team and
                            replicate colocation as closely as possible using virtual tools. Although not ideal, the
                            effective use of virtual tools can gain most of the benefits of colocation in a virtual
                            environment. Since this project is being operated under the umbrella of a predictive
                            approach, an approved change request will be required to revise the resource management plan
                            and possibly other elements of the project management plan.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Request a change to the resource management plan to incorporate the use of virtual tools
                            to replicate colocation in a remote environment<br>
                            Correct. Since physical colocation is no longer an option, the best course of action is to
                            replicate colocation as closely as possible using virtual tools. Since the resource
                            management plan requires colocation, an approved change request would be required to modify
                            the relevant section of the plan that specifies the team's working environment.<br>
                            B. Examine virtual team member needs, investigate alternatives, and implement options for
                            virtual team member engagement<br>
                            Incorrect. This answer choice represents actions that should be taken in order to mitigate
                            the negative effects of the new project constraint described in the scenario. Although you
                            would likely be able to examine virtual team member needs and investigate alternatives, you
                            would not be able to 'implement' options for virtual team member engagement without first
                            obtaining an approved change request for this action.<br>
                            C. Submit a change request to update the project management plan to migrate the project
                            management approach from hybrid to predictive<br>
                            Incorrect. While an approved change request to update various elements of the project
                            management plan would be necessary to change the project lifecycle from hybrid to
                            predictive, there is no information presented by the question to suggest this action would
                            mitigate the problem described in the scenario.<br>
                            D. Put the project on hold until the pandemic is over and then bring the team back on-site
                            to comply with the resource management plan<br>
                            Incorrect. Putting the project on hold is an overreaction to the situation presented in this
                            scenario. Additionally, it is not likely that a project manager would have the authority to
                            put a project on hold. Also, it is unclear if waiting until the pandemic is over is a
                            realistic option. Waiting until the pandemic is over might put the project at risk of
                            failure.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            On any project, a classic struggle exists between the risk and value associated with a
                            feature. The solution is to give neither risk nor value total supremacy when prioritizing.
                            Considering both risk and value is essential to prioritize work optimally. The high-value /
                            high-risk features should be developed first. These features deliver the most value, and
                            working on them eliminates significant risk. As a general rule concerning risk and value,
                            agile practitioners should use the guideline to work first on high-value features but use
                            risk as a tie-breaker. Another point to keep in mind is that a feature's risk and value
                            profile will most likely change over time and will require constant monitoring and possible
                            re-prioritization.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Low-risk / high-value<br>
                            Incorrect. Low-risk / high-value features bear the same high value as high-risk / high-value
                            features. However, developing the low-risk / high-value features first means postponing the
                            development of high-risk / high-value features. If risks associated with the high-risk /
                            high-value features realizes later in the project, the chances of properly addressing those
                            risks reduce, thus decreasing the probability of project success.<br>
                            B. High-risk / high-value<br>
                            Correct. High-risk / high-value features should be developed first. These features deliver
                            the most value, and working on them eliminates significant risk or allows sufficient time to
                            address the risk if one arises.<br>
                            C. Low-risk / low-value<br>
                            Incorrect. Low-risk / low-value features should be developed after the high-risk /
                            high-value features, and low-risk / high-value features have been developed. Low-risk /
                            low-value features will have less impact on the total value of the product if they are
                            dropped. Additionally, developing these features late in the project poses a low risk.<br>
                            D. High-risk / low-value<br>
                            Incorrect. High-risk / low-value features should be avoided. There is no reason to take on a
                            high degree of risk for a feature of limited value.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            One of the key responsibilities of the scrum master, as a servant leader, is to eliminate
                            roadblocks and other issues that could be negatively affecting the productivity of the team.
                            In the scenario described, the development team's productivity is suffering because of
                            constant requests for information coming from the stakeholder as well as the stakeholder's
                            intrusive questions forcing the team to defend how they do their work. Therefore, it may be
                            necessary to isolate the development team from these distractions. This can be done by
                            implementing a ground rule that specifies that all requests for information from the
                            developers should come through the scrum master and not directly to the development team.
                            This approach is a common agile practice.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Remove impediments and roadblocks that interfere with the team's progress<br>
                            Correct. The scrum master, as a servant leader, must protect the development team from
                            distractions that may negatively affect productivity. Removing impediments and roadblocks
                            that interfere with the team's progress is a generic answer. In the scenario described, this
                            means requiring the stakeholder to direct inquiries to the scrum master.<br>
                            B. Encourage the team to interact with and address the needs of the stakeholder<br>
                            Incorrect. Collaborating with stakeholders is one of the fundamental principles of agile
                            teams. The scenario does not explicitly state that the stakeholder was the main reason for
                            the team's productive drop. However, the scenario implies the stakeholder has something to
                            do with the drop. Therefore, before encouraging the team to interact with and address the
                            needs of the stakeholder, analyzing the situation and making an informed decision would be a
                            better course of action for the scrum master.<br>
                            C. Isolate the team from the stakeholder and any other external influences<br>
                            Incorrect. It would be appropriate to talk to the stakeholder and set expectations as to how
                            the interactions with the team should be carried out. However, isolating the team from 'any'
                            outside influence is an over-reaction and runs against the general agile principles of
                            collaboration, shared participation, and customer involvement. While some 'defense'
                            mechanisms should be in place to allow the team to work effectively, those mechanisms have
                            to be reasonable rather than isolating the team entirely from the outside world.<br>
                            D. Provide the team with anything they need to be more motivated and productive<br>
                            Incorrect. The issue is not the team that lacks motivation, but one that is being
                            interrupted by a stakeholder's desire for more information and the stakeholder's belief that
                            they need to be actively participating in all aspects of the project. Providing performance
                            incentives or other techniques to motivate the team is not an appropriate solution for this
                            situation.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            An iteration burndown chart is an example of a data analysis technique that can be used as
                            part of the Control Schedule process described in the scenario. To assist the project team
                            monitor and control the costs and schedule of an iteration, a burndown chart displays the
                            planned work to be completed and the associated costs or resources allocated to work.
                            Typically, the burndown chart begins with the sum value of the work on the left then trends
                            down to the end point of the iteration. All the work is expected to be done at the end of
                            the iteration. Hence, the endpoint is to be at zero for work and costs remaining. The ideal
                            burndown rate line is that straight line from the start of the iteration to the last point
                            in the iteration when all the work is to be done. Work completed faster than planned has a
                            steeper slope than the ideal line. That line is reaching the zero work remaining point
                            faster.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. The remaining work line is above the ideal burndown rate<br>
                            Incorrect. The remaining work line will be above the ideal burndown rate if the work is
                            being completed behind schedule. In the scenario, work is being completed well ahead of
                            schedule implying the remaining work line is below, not above, the ideal burndown rate.<br>
                            B. The remaining work line is below the ideal burndown rate<br>
                            Correct. At the start of the iteration, the ideal burndown rate of the work and costs are
                            mapped. The ideal burndown rate typically is a straight line from the total of story points
                            at the start to zero at the end of the iteration. In this scenario, the project is burning
                            points faster than expected, resulting in the remaining work line to be below the ideal
                            burndown rate.<br>
                            C. The earned value line is below the planned value line<br>
                            Incorrect. The earned value and the planned value lines are typically displayed using a
                            burnup, not burndown, chart. If a burnup chart were used in this scenario, the earned value
                            line would be above, not below, the planned value line, meaning the project is earning more
                            value than planned.<br>
                            D. Cannot be determined from the information provided<br>
                            Incorrect. When work is being completed well ahead of schedule, an iteration burndown chart
                            will show the line that represents work completed tracing below the line that represents the
                            ideal burndown rate. Therefore, saying that the answer to the question asked cannot be
                            determined from the information provided would be illogical.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            Similar to some other questions, this question describes a seemingly weird project
                            management approach in which elements of traditional methods (CCB, scope baseline)
                            intertwine with agile practices (product increments, iterations). Such a combination of
                            methods from different project management methodologies results in a hybrid project
                            management approach. In the scenario, the product is developed in iterations, which
                            typically (although not always) means the work items are organized as a backlog. The backlog
                            is a list of work items that are prioritized by the product owner in consultation with the
                            team and relevant stakeholders. New features/requirements, changes to existing features, as
                            well as defect repairs for already developed product increments, are considered work items.
                            Therefore, it makes sense for the work to be carried out using a
                            single-list-of-work-and-changes approach.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. As specified in the requirements traceability matrix<br>
                            Incorrect. The requirements traceability matrix is a project document in the form of a grid
                            that links product requirements from their origin to the deliverables that satisfy them.
                            This document does not have any guidelines as to how work to implement requirements,
                            changes, and defect repairs should be carried out on a project.<br>
                            B. According to the organizational process assets<br>
                            Incorrect. Organizational process assets (OPAs) are the processes, policies, and procedures
                            specific to and used by the performing organization. While the OPAs may contain guidelines
                            on how work should be carried out in the organization in general, each project has its own
                            specific instructions, typically outlined in the project management plan.<br>
                            C. Using a single-list-of-work-and-changes approach<br>
                            Correct. This term, 'single-list-of-work-and-changes' refers to the product backlog, which
                            is, as its name implies, a list of items such as requirements, changes, and defect repairs
                            that should be completed during the project. The list is prioritized, and the items are
                            pulled out by the project team from the top of the backlog.<br>
                            D. By implementing enterprise environmental factors<br>
                            Incorrect. Enterprise environmental factors (EEFs) are conditions, not under the control of
                            the project team, that influence, constrain, or direct the project. EEFs do not provide
                            instructions as to how work should be carried out in projects and are not something that can
                            be 'implemented'.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            The scenario describes a situation where project team members have been adding features not
                            included in the planned scope. The team members think these features are interesting and
                            useful for the customer. This practice is known as gold plating. The question also states
                            that the project has a work breakdown structure (WBS) and baselines, which implies that a
                            traditional waterfall framework is being employed for this project. A daily standup meeting
                            is a common ceremony used on agile projects, but can also be incorporated into a predictive
                            model. One of the objectives of a daily standup meeting is for each team member to identify
                            what they plan to accomplish during the next 24-hour period. If the project manager can gain
                            an understanding of the work planned for the day, they can address any deviations from the
                            planned work beforehand. Of the available answer choices, instituting a daily standup
                            meeting has the best probability of eliminating, or at least reducing, the gold plating.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Adopt an agile approach so the team can develop any features they deem valuable<br>
                            Incorrect. With agile methodologies, the features to be developed are captured in the
                            product backlog, which is managed by the product owner. The development team is not likely
                            to have the authority to develop any features they deem of value. Gold plating should be
                            avoided regardless of the project management framework used.<br>
                            B. Submit a change request to capture the gold plating problem in the issue log<br>
                            Incorrect. The issue of gold plating should be captured in the issue log. However, the issue
                            log is a project document. Unless stated otherwise in the scenario, project documents do not
                            require an approved change request to be revised.<br>
                            C. Discuss the issue at the project retrospective and update the lessons learned
                            register<br>
                            Incorrect. The issue of gold plating should be discussed during the project retrospective,
                            and any knowledge gained should then be recorded in the lessons learned register. However,
                            the project retrospective occurs at the end of the project, which will be too late to
                            prevent gold plating with the current project.<br>
                            D. Incorporate the agile practice of holding daily standup meetings with the team<br>
                            Correct. The daily standup meetings reveal the work planned by the team members for the
                            current day. Therefore, these meetings should aid the project manager in identifying any
                            unplanned work before the action takes place.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            The Tuckman ladder is one of the models used to describe stages of team development. This
                            model is typically referred to by project management practitioners as part of the Develop
                            Team process. The model includes five stages: forming, storming, norming, performing, and
                            adjourning. While it is safe to say that most teams go through all five stages, some may get
                            stuck in a particular stage or even regress (go back) to an earlier stage. On the other
                            hand, projects with team members who worked together in the past might skip a stage. Each
                            stage is distinguished by different dynamics among the team members resulting in various
                            levels of team effectiveness. Team effectiveness is at its lowest level during the storming
                            stage as the environment is characterized by a high degree of conflict and a lack of
                            collaboration among the team members. As the team members begin to work together and trust
                            each other, in other words, the relationships between the team members normalize (thus the
                            name of the next stage, norming), the degree of team effectiveness increases. Teams that
                            successfully go through the norming stage would eventually reach the performing stage, which
                            is the highest level of team development. In the performing stage, the team function as a
                            well-organized unit, and the team effectiveness is at its highest.<br>
                            The role of a project manager (or scrum master, agile coach, servant leader, facilitator,
                            etc.) is also different during different team development stages. In the forming stage, the
                            project leader should set goals, provide direction, and help establish ground rules. During
                            the storming stage, which is typically the most difficult one, the project leader should
                            facilitate conversations between the team members, ensure that the team members listen to
                            and respect each other, and help resolve conflicts. The norming stage allows the project
                            leader to loosen their grip, let the team resolve issues and conflicts, and step in as
                            needed to ensure the team keeps moving in the right direction. When the team reaches the
                            performing stage, the project leader typically acts as an observer stepping in only when a
                            decision needs to be made at a higher level within the organization. And finally, during the
                            adjourning stage, which coincides with the end of the project, a good project leader ensures
                            the team is recognized for their achievement in project completion, the success is
                            celebrated, and lessons learned are captured.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. A<br>
                            Incorrect. Area A represents the forming phase of the team development model. In this phase,
                            the team members meet and learn about the project and their formal roles and
                            responsibilities. Team members tend to be independent and not as open. The scenario
                            describes a team working as a well-organized unit, making this choice an incorrect
                            answer.<br>
                            B. B<br>
                            Incorrect. Area B represents the storming phase of team development. During this phase, the
                            team begins to address the project work, technical decisions, and the project management
                            approach. If team members are not collaborative, the environment can become
                            counterproductive, resulting in low team effectiveness. This description does not match the
                            one provided in the scenario.<br>
                            C. C<br>
                            Incorrect. Area C represents the norming stage of the team development model. In this phase,
                            team members begin to work together and adjust their work habits and behavior to support the
                            team. The team members learn to trust each other. In the scenario, the team has reached a
                            more advanced stage in their development.<br>
                            D. D<br>
                            Correct. Area D represents the performing stage of the team development model, where the
                            team's performance is at its highest level. Teams that reach this level of development,
                            function as well-organized units. The team members are interdependent and work through
                            issues smoothly and effectively. The scenario closely matches this description, making
                            performing the best answer to the question asked.<br>
                            E. E<br>
                            Incorrect. Area E represents the adjourning stage of the team development model. This is the
                            last stage of the Tuckman ladder, in which the team completes the work and moves on from the
                            project. The scenario implies the team is still working together (carrying out one of the
                            sprints), suggesting adjourning is an incorrect answer.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            A task board (often called a Kanban board) is an information radiator that serves the dual
                            purpose of giving a development team a convenient mechanism for organizing their work and a
                            way to see at a glance how much work is left to be completed in an iteration. In flow-based
                            agile, the team pulls features from the backlog based on its capacity to start work rather
                            than on an iteration-based schedule. Iteration-based teams typically use task boards to
                            reflect the work to be completed in an iteration. The team defines its workflow with columns
                            on a task board and manages the work in progress for each column. A task board makes these
                            tasks highly visible so that everyone can see which tasks are being worked on and which
                            tasks are available for selection.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. A burndown chart<br>
                            Incorrect. A burndown chart is a visual representation of the project’s progress over time.
                            It accomplishes this by displaying the actual amount of work remaining in the project, which
                            will ‘burn down’ over time. Burndown charts are an agile project team's preferred tool used
                            to display project progress, but they are not a simple way of organizing and managing
                            project work.<br>
                            B. A task board<br>
                            Correct. A task board is an information radiator that serves the dual purpose of giving your
                            agile project team a convenient mechanism for organizing their work, and a way to see at a
                            glance how much work is left in the iteration.<br>
                            C. A burnup chart<br>
                            Incorrect. The burnup chart is the opposite of the burndown chart. The burnup chart is also
                            a visual representation of the project’s progress over time. However, it accomplishes this
                            by displaying the actual amount of work completed so far on the project, rather than the
                            amount of work remaining. Burnup charts are normally used to show progress at the project
                            level but can also be used at the release level to reflect any added scope to the release or
                            project over time.<br>
                            D. A glance chart<br>
                            Incorrect. A "glance" chart is not a recognized term used in project management. It's a term
                            made up for this question.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            The project charter once signed and approved, is a commitment by the organization to
                            dedicate the required time and resources needed for the project. The project manager is
                            named and authorized to use organizational resources for project activities. An approved
                            charter validates the alignment of the project to the strategy and ongoing work of the
                            organization. These all describe the purpose of a project charter. The question, however, is
                            asking what is not a purpose of the project charter. While the charter authorizes the
                            project manager to expend organizational resources on the project, the charter does not
                            authorize functional management responsibilities to the project manager. Functional
                            management responsibilities are determined by a company's corporate structure and not by a
                            project charter.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. To provide a formal record of the project<br>
                            Incorrect. The approved project charter provides the formal existence of a project and
                            therefore a formal record. Since this answer is a purpose of the project charter, it is not
                            correct.<br>
                            B. To provide a direct link between the project and the company's strategic objectives<br>
                            Incorrect. An approved project charter validates the alignment of the project to the
                            strategy and ongoing work of the organization. Since the question is asking which option
                            does 'not' represent a purpose of the project charter, this answer is incorrect.<br>
                            C. To show organizational commitment to the project<br>
                            Incorrect. The approved project charter gives management's stamp of approval to the project
                            and therefore, an organizational commitment to the project.<br>
                            D. To authorize functional management responsibilities to the project manager<br>
                            Correct. An approved project charter provides the project manager with the authority to
                            apply organizational resources to project activities but does not provide functional
                            management responsibilities to the project manager. Management responsibilities are
                            determined by the organizational structure of the company.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            Based on the scenario described, the client has not accepted the deliverables; they only
                            acknowledged receipt of the goods. Your actions of beginning the closing process of the
                            project are premature. Closed procurements are required to close the project. The
                            procurement cannot be closed until the buyer, your client, provides the seller, you, with
                            formal written notice that the contract has been completed. Therefore, since the client has
                            not yet accepted the deliverables, you should contact the client to understand why they
                            believe the deliverables do not meet the terms and conditions of the agreement.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Call the client and tell them that they have accepted the deliverables and should now pay
                            the final invoice<br>
                            Incorrect. Your actions of starting the closing process of the project are premature. The
                            email states that the goods were received but does not indicate that the client has accepted
                            the deliverables. The verbiage contained in the email does not meet the criteria of formal
                            written notice that the contract has been completed.<br>
                            B. Call the client to understand why they think the deliverables do not meet the required
                            specifications<br>
                            Correct. Based on the scenario, the client has not accepted the deliverables; the client has
                            only acknowledged receipt of the goods. The procurement should not be closed until your
                            client provides you with formal written notice that the contract has been completed. At this
                            point, all you have received is a notice of receipt of the deliverables. Therefore, you
                            should contact the client to understand why they think the deliverables do not meet the
                            terms and conditions of the agreement.<br>
                            C. Contact the legal department to check the contract and ask them to suggest a course of
                            action<br>
                            Incorrect. Contacting the legal department is a premature action. First, you need to
                            understand what aspect of the deliverables, according to your client, does not meet the
                            terms and conditions as outlined in the contract.<br>
                            D. Ignore the voicemail from the client since their email indicates that they have already
                            accepted the deliverables<br>
                            Incorrect. Your client never indicated that the deliverables met the contractual

                            Explanation: <br>
                            Work performance data is raw observations and measurements that are collected during project
                            execution. Work performance data is an input to various controlling processes where it is
                            analyzed and put into context and becomes an output called work performance information.
                            Work performance reports are the organized presentation of the work performance information
                            used to generate decisions, raise issues, or awareness. Since the information you have
                            received is raw data and out of context, it is work performance data.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Work performance data<br>
                            Correct. Work performance data is the raw results, measurements, and observations obtained
                            during the Direct and Manage Project Work process.<br>
                            B. Progress activity data<br>
                            Incorrect. 'Progress activity data' is a made-up term for this question.<br>
                            C. Work performance reports<br>
                            Incorrect. Work performance reports are the organized presentation of the work performance
                            information. These reports are provided to various stakeholders who need the information.
                            The information you have received from your team is simply data which has not been put into
                            any context.<br>
                            D. Work performance information<br>
                            Incorrect. Work performance information is work performance data that is analyzed in context
                            and compared against the project management plan during the controlling processes. Based on
                            the scenario described, you are reviewing raw data that has not yet been analyzed.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            Before taking an action or making a decision, the one should first determine the context of
                            the conflict. To do this, the agile coach will need to spend time with the team members. The
                            agile coach will have to observe the team in their natural environment for a few days or
                            even weeks. Observing the group for a few minutes will not be sufficient to understand the
                            team's social dynamics. Since there is no information provided in the scenario that suggests
                            that immediate intervention is necessary, it would be best for the agile coach to observe
                            the team's interactions over the following days to determine what action, if any, is
                            warranted.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Observe the team's interactions over the next week<br>
                            Correct. In order to understand the context of the conflict, the agile coach will need to
                            spend solid time with the team members. Once the agile coach has a better insight into the
                            team dynamics, an informed decision can be made regarding what action to take, if any.<br>
                            B. Allow the team to work virtually to minimize interactions<br>
                            Incorrect. Agile best practices favor colocation over virtual teams. This sentiment is
                            reflected in the Agile Manifesto principle stating, "The most efficient and effective method
                            of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation."
                            Some level of conflict is normal within a team and would not be a sufficient reason to
                            organize the group as a virtual team.<br>
                            C. Escalate the issue to the human resources manager<br>
                            Incorrect. According to the scenario, the agile coach 'suspects' there is a problem. It is a
                            subjective opinion. The coach should first determine the nature and source of the conflict,
                            if any, before taking any steps or making decisions. Escalating the issue to the human
                            resources manager is a premature action and may not be even required or appropriate at
                            all.<br>
                            D. Ignore the problem as agile teams are self-managing<br>
                            Incorrect. Agile teams are self-managing, and there is not enough information presented in
                            this scenario to determine what, if any, action is needed. While it is possible that the
                            agile coach may or may not choose not to intervene, she should, at a minimum, continue
                            monitoring the situation rather than just ignoring the problem entirely. Note that in most
                            questions, ignoring any problem with the project or project team is unlikely to be a correct
                            answer.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            The procurement SOW is developed from the project scope baseline and describes the item of
                            acquisition in sufficient detail to allow prospective sellers to provide an estimate for the
                            work. A significant discrepancy between sellers' responses suggests the information
                            furnished to them did not wholly or clearly describe the procurement item. The prospective
                            sellers either misunderstood or failed to respond adequately to the procurement SOW. Expert
                            judgment and data analysis can be used as tools and techniques to evaluate the seller
                            responses during the Conduct Procurement process described in the scenario. The procurement
                            SOW can be reviewed, revised and refined as required until it has been incorporated into a
                            signed agreement with a seller. The variance in the received seller responses strongly
                            suggests a review of the procurement SOW is conducted prior to taking further action.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Select the seller with the highest estimate<br>
                            Incorrect. The large discrepancy between the estimates suggests there is something wrong
                            with the quotes; perhaps there was not a clear understanding of the requirements by the
                            sellers. In addition, there is not enough information provided in the question to suggest
                            that the seller with the highest estimate is better than the other quotes. With the highest
                            estimate, you need to ensure that the cost is justified and evaluate all the proposals based
                            on source selection criteria before deciding.<br>
                            B. Take the seller with the highest estimate to court<br>
                            Incorrect. Taking the seller to court is an example of claims administration tools and
                            techniques that can be used as part of the Control Procurements process to resolve contested
                            changes between a buyer and a seller. Not only this action is extreme, but it is also
                            premature as the scenario does not describe any conflict between the parties.<br>
                            C. Select the seller with the lowest estimate<br>
                            Incorrect. The large discrepancy between the estimates suggests there is something wrong
                            with the quotes; perhaps there was not a clear understanding of the requirements by the
                            sellers. If the seller with the lowest estimate is chosen, it may end up costing more in the
                            future when change orders are needed to meet the desired requirements.<br>
                            D. Review the procurement statement of work<br>
                            Correct. Significant differences in the estimates can suggest that the procurement SOW was
                            incomplete or that the prospective sellers did not fully understand the requirements. The
                            procurement SOW must be clear and describe all the work the seller is required to complete.
                            Since there is a significant discrepancy in the received seller responses, reviewing the
                            procurement SOW is the best choice.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            The primary purpose of the charter is to formally authorize the project and, most
                            importantly, provide the project manager with the authority to apply organizational
                            resources to project activities. In this situation, the project has already begun without a
                            charter. However, the scenario does not provide details about how well the project is
                            progressing. Projects without charters can suffer for multiple reasons. A project charter
                            defines what the project should deliver and sets out management’s expectations for results.
                            Therefore, without a charter, there are no clear expectations for project outcomes allowing
                            the potential for the project to drift without any real results. Also, the project can face
                            roadblocks due to the unavailability of resources and the project manager not having the
                            written authority to acquire resources. Since the scenario does not give any details on the
                            project other than it does not have a charter, and the project charter has significant
                            benefits, the best answer to the question asked is to develop a charter at the point where
                            you entered the project.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Establish a project charter at the point where you entered the project<br>
                            Correct. Although the project is in execution, establishing a project charter is still
                            beneficial. The project charter legitimizes the project and your authority. The charter also
                            ensures there is a common understanding by the stakeholders of what the project will deliver
                            as well as the roles and responsibilities of everyone involved in the project.<br>
                            B. Continue the project without a project charter<br>
                            Incorrect. Even though your project is in execution, establishing a project charter will be
                            beneficial. Executives use the project charter to verify that the project is in line with
                            corporate strategic goals. Project team members use the project charter to understand if the
                            project is meeting the organization's business need.<br>
                            C. Terminate the project because a project cannot exist without a project charter<br>
                            Incorrect. While it is important to have the project charter that authorizes the project and
                            the project manager, terminating the project that is already in execution just because the
                            project charter does not exist is an over-reaction.<br>
                            D. Wait and see if a project charter is necessary<br>
                            Incorrect. Taking a 'wait and see' approach is essentially the same as continuing the
                            project without a charter. There are benefits to having a project charter and if you 'wait
                            and see,' chances are you will not have a charter when you need it.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            Because each project is unique, it is necessary to tailor the way Project Risk Management
                            processes are applied to a project. Project size and complexity have a direct impact on
                            overall project risk. A large and complex project requires a more robust risk management
                            plan and a more detailed risk register to address the increased level of overall project
                            risk. The outcomes of these tailoring decisions are recorded in the risk management plan.
                            Using the risk management plan and risk register from a previous project as a template for a
                            larger and more complex project without tailoring would likely result in the realization of
                            risks without adequate response plans, which may jeopardize the project's objectives.
                            Therefore, of the available choices, the lack of tailoring of the risk management plan is
                            what most likely caused the project to be terminated before completion.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Using templates to create the risk management plan and risk register<br>
                            Incorrect. The use of templates is a project management best practice to save time and
                            effort. Templates might be found as part of the organizational process assets or derived
                            from past similar projects. While using templates is an excellent idea, the templates used
                            for risk management must be tailored to the size and complexity of the project.<br>
                            B. Failing to implement the agreed-upon risk responses<br>
                            Incorrect. The question states that the high-impact risks that were encountered by the
                            project were unexpected, which suggests that these risks were not previously identified. Any
                            potential risk responses, which were planned &amp; agreed-upon, were not applicable, as they
                            pertained to other risks.<br>
                            C. Lack of tailoring of the risk management plan and risk register<br>
                            Correct. Project size and complexity have a direct impact on overall project risk. A large
                            and complex project will require a more robust risk management plan and a more detailed risk
                            register.<br>
                            D. Propinquity was too high during project planning<br>
                            Incorrect. Propinquity is the degree to which the risk is perceived to matter by one or more
                            stakeholders. High propinquity is more likely to lead to a more robust risk management plan
                            and more thorough identification of risks along with well-developed risk responses. In this
                            scenario, the project encountered several unexpected, high-impact risks, which implies that

                            Explanation: <br>
                            The level of precision for costs is defined in the cost management plan and can be described
                            as the degree to which costs estimates will be rounded up or down, based on the scope of the
                            activities and magnitude of the project. Reporting a cost variance to the penny implies a
                            level of precision that is not realistic, as the project's cost variance is constantly
                            changing. Additionally, although the money spent might be obtained for any point in a
                            project, the earned value needed to calculate the cost variance is more subjective.
                            Therefore, providing a cost variance to the penny implies a level of precision that is not
                            obtainable. In this case, it would be more appropriate to report the cost variance as
                            $25,000.<br>
                            As an analogy, imagine if a scientist stated that a particular dinosaur bone was 100,000,127
                            years old. However, the test used to determine the age may only be accurate to a few million
                            years. Stating the age to the exact number of years implies that the scientist has
                            determined the age to an exact year when that is not the case, regardless of the test
                            results.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. The variance was calculated incorrectly.<br>
                            Incorrect. There is not enough information presented in the scenario to determine whether
                            the variance was calculated correctly.<br>
                            B. The level of precision is not correct.<br>
                            Correct. Most projects have a level of precision that would round the variance rather than
                            report a cost variance to the penny. For example, $25,000 would be a more reasonable
                            number.<br>
                            C. The variance is greatly exaggerated.<br>
                            Incorrect. There is no information provided in the question to indicate that the extent of
                            the variance in cost is exaggerated.<br>
                            D. The variance should be a negative value.<br>
                            Incorrect. A variance can be negative, positive, or zero. Positive variances are generally
                            an indication that a project is running under planned costs, as described in the
                            question.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            People need time to build relationships and learn about each other. There is a time a place
                            for relationship building and providing a way for casual conversation is important. To avoid
                            distracting the other team members, these off-topic conversations need to be incorporated in
                            a manner that does not interfere with project work. Establishing a separate channel for
                            topics unrelated to the project and politely asking the team members to use it, represents
                            an appropriate balance between the project work and team building.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Nothing. Online chat is a release for people getting to know one another.<br>
                            Incorrect. The question indicates that the off-topic conversations are distracting, which is
                            an issue that should be addressed. People need to use the tool to build and reinforce the
                            team, but they need to do it without impeding other communication.<br>
                            B. Eliminate the chat tool and instruct the team to use email and phone instead.<br>
                            Incorrect. It is important for the project team members to be able to establish positive
                            working relationships, and it is unrealistic to avoid some personal interactions. Replacing
                            the tool with email and phone is likely to be an ineffective approach and may even
                            demoralize the team. Additionally, neither email nor phone can prevent non-work related
                            conversations.<br>
                            C. Join in on the fun and encourage the team to keep on with this type of conversation.<br>
                            Incorrect. Too much conversation that is unrelated to work may annoy some people, causes a
                            distraction, and important information may be lost in the jocular banter.<br>
                            D. Request the team to use another channel for non-work related conversations.<br>
                            Correct. The project manager needs to establish a healthy balance between the project work
                            and team building. This approach represents a way to allow the project team members to focus
                            on the project work when needed and building positive working relationships.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            In this scenario, a project team has developed a comprehensive list of items for their
                            social contract. With the team's working agreements, more is not necessarily better. With a
                            list of 27 working agreements, it may not be realistic for the development team to remember
                            and apply the entire list. Additionally, the most important working agreements may get lost
                            among the more trivial elements. Thus, agile best practices limit the team working
                            agreements to the top five to ten items. Suggesting that the development team reduce their
                            commitments to the five to ten most important elements would likely prove more
                            effective.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Request the project sponsor to select the items for the team charter<br>
                            Incorrect. While the project sponsor may have some basic ideas as to how to improve the
                            situation, it is unlikely the sponsor has insight into the team dynamics. Agile teams are
                            self-organizing, and it is up to the team to decide on how to work together and what values,
                            agreements, and operating guidelines to adopt.<br>
                            B. Recommend reducing the working agreements to the top five to ten items<br>
                            Correct. Agile best practices limit the team working agreements to the top five to ten
                            items. Creating an expansive list of working agreements will make it difficult for the
                            project team to remember and apply all of them.<br>
                            C. Adopt the team agreements used by another project team<br>
                            Incorrect. Team agreements are most effective when they are developed by the project team
                            members themselves. Some elements of the social contract may not even be relevant to a
                            different team. The project team might choose to use another project team's agreements as a
                            starting point, but it is the project team members themselves who should have input into the
                            working agreements, by which they are going to be bound.<br>
                            D. Expand the working agreements to include all possible sources of conflict<br>
                            Incorrect. It is not realistic to capture all possible sources of conflict in the team
                            charter. Even if one could capture all of the possibilities, the team charter would be so
                            long that it would not provide much value.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            It seems as if the sponsor does not completely understand how project status is reported on
                            agile projects. Project status reports are typically used on projects that are carried out
                            using the predictive (traditional/waterfall) project management approach. Agile projects,
                            however, like the one described in the scenario, use different tools and technics to share
                            project progress with the stakeholders. Information radiators are the most commonly used
                            tools to address the reporting need. However, this answer choice is not provided. Another
                            way to apprise stakeholders of the value gain process is to demonstrate the product
                            increment developed during a sprint at the sprint review meeting. The scrum master's task in
                            this situation is to educate the sponsor about agile best practices. One of them is to have
                            the stakeholders attend the sprint review meeting where they can see in their own eyes the
                            product increment built by the team. Therefore, of the choices provided, inviting the
                            sponsor to the sprint review meeting is the best course of action for the scrum master.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Sprint planning meeting<br>
                            Incorrect. The sprint planning meeting is an agile collaborative event, in which the team
                            plans the work for the current sprint. While this event may provide some information as to
                            the project progress, the main goal of the meeting is to plan, not to share the project
                            progress with the stakeholders.<br>
                            B. Daily standup meeting<br>
                            Incorrect. The daily standup is a brief collaborative meeting in which the team members
                            review progress from the previous day, declare intentions for the current day, and
                            highlights any obstacles encountered or anticipated. This meeting would not provide the
                            sponsor with information regarding the overall project and its progress.<br>
                            C. Sprint review meeting<br>
                            Correct. The sprint review meeting is a meeting in which the development team demonstrates
                            the product increment developed during the sprint to the customer, product owner, as well as
                            any other interested stakeholders. By attending this event, the sponsor, in their own eyes,
                            will be able to see the working product increment and make conclusions as to how well the
                            project progresses.<br>
                            D. Sprint retrospective meeting<br>
                            Incorrect. A sprint retrospective is a meeting held at the end of a sprint in which
                            participants explore their work and results in order to improve the process used to develop
                            the product. This meeting provides value for the project team to improve their performance
                            but would be of little benefit to the project sponsor in terms of project status.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            Projects characterized by unclear requirements that are going to change as the project
                            progresses, are best served by the agile project management approach. This approach embraces
                            change, engages stakeholders continuously, and favors short development cycles to
                            incrementally adjust the product based on the changing requirements, market demand, and
                            feedback from the stakeholders. The smartphone project described in the scenario is one that
                            predominantly has the above characteristics. However, one of the smartphone components, its
                            camera, is going to be produced by an external vendor who is not willing to collaborate in
                            an incremental way. This means that instead of integrating each new increment of the
                            smartphone with the new increment of the camera, the project team will have to wait for the
                            development of the camera to be completed and only then try to integrate the camera with the
                            latest product increment of the smartphone. While this is not the best approach to manage a
                            project, sometimes there is no other option. This situation can happen when a particular
                            element of the project is either not executable using an agile approach or is
                            non-negotiable, like in the scenario described where the vendor refuses to cooperate in an
                            agile way. In such situations, the best approach to select is predominantly agile with some
                            predictive components.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Predominantly agile with some predictive components<br>
                            Correct. Most of the project requirements are unclear and will need to be elaborated as the
                            project progresses. Under these circumstances, agile would be the best approach for the
                            project. However, one component (the camera) is not part of the incremental development,
                            forcing you to apply a predictive approach to the integration part of the project.<br>
                            B. Predominantly predictive with some agile components<br>
                            Incorrect. With many anticipated changes, selecting predominantly a predictive approach for
                            the project is not the best course of action. Projects with a lot of uncertainty are served
                            best with agile methods that develop products incrementally. The integration of the
                            components that are not delivered incrementally will have to follow the predictive
                            approach.<br>
                            C. Predictive during planning and agile during execution<br>
                            Incorrect. It is hard to impossible to create plans early in the project life cycle when
                            requirements are unclear and will likely change a lot as the project progresses. Therefore,
                            while executing the project using agile methods makes sense, selecting the predictive
                            project management approach during planning does not sound like a good idea.<br>
                            D. Agile during planning and predictive during execution<br>
                            Incorrect. Selecting agile methods during planning fits the nature of the project, which is
                            characterized by unclear requirements. However, since the requirements are going to change
                            and the product adjusted accordingly, executing the project using predictive methods would
                            not work well.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            The question suggests that the Implement Risk Responses process is being performed. Project
                            team assignments are one of the project documents that may be updated as a result of this
                            process. In the scenario, a previously identified risk has been realized. The risk response
                            requires the reassignment of a project team member to address the problem. Once the risk
                            responses are confirmed, the necessary resources should be allocated to each action
                            associated with the risk response plan. These resources include suitably qualified and
                            experienced personnel to execute the agreed-upon action (usually within the project team), a
                            specific budget and time allowance for the action, and any required technical resources to
                            complete the action. Of the available choices, only the project team assignments should be
                            updated as the result of implementing risk responses.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. The quality management plan<br>
                            Incorrect. The quality management plan is a component of the project management plan that
                            describes how applicable policies, procedures, and guidelines will be implemented to achieve
                            the quality objectives set for the project. The fact the team member initially assigned to
                            address the problem is unavailable does not change the contents of the quality management
                            plan nor its objectives.<br>
                            B. The risk response report<br>
                            Incorrect. 'Risk response report' is a fake term made up for this question<br>
                            C. The lessons learned repository<br>
                            Incorrect. The lessons learned repository is a store of historical information about lessons
                            learned from projects. The lessons learned repository is not updated until project closure
                            began when the information contained in the lessons learned register is transferred to the
                            lessons learned repository.<br>
                            D. The project team assignments<br>
                            Correct. Resources associated with the implementation of the risk response plans should be
                            allocated to each action specified in the risk register. As a result, the project team
                            assignments document should be updated accordingly to reflect the changes in the team
                            members' assignments, making this choice the best answer to the question asked.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            Ideally, for an agile project to be successful, all team members should be co-located to
                            benefit from the most efficient way of communication, face-to-face. Co-location would also
                            allow the team members to use highly effective agile high-touch/low-tech tools. However,
                            setting up a fully co-located team is not always possible. In many cases, some of the team
                            members would likely work remotely. In such situations, project managers aspiring to promote
                            agile best practices should find creative ways to use substitute tools to mimic a co-located
                            environment. While none of the answer choices provided in the question has a complete set of
                            all tools available for the agile teams to communicate and collaborate efficiently, one
                            choice has a combination of high-touch/low-tech tools (whiteboards, index cards, sticky
                            notes) and low-touch/high-tech tools (web cameras, microphones). The first set would help
                            the co-located team members to communicate among themselves, while the second set may help
                            the co-located team members communicate with their remote peers.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Whiteboards, index cards, sticky notes, flip charts<br>
                            Incorrect. The items described in this answer choice would only meet the needs of the
                            co-located team members. However, these tools would not support the collaboration between
                            the collocated portion of the team and those working remotely in the different time
                            zones.<br>
                            B. Instant messaging applications, web cameras, microphones<br>
                            Incorrect. Instant messaging applications, web cameras, microphones would enable
                            communication between the co-located and remote team members since these tools are mainly
                            designed to bridge the gap for teams where not everyone is collocated. Agile promotes the
                            use of high-touch/low-tech tools, such as whiteboards, index cards, sticky notes. Without
                            these tools, the collocated team members would not take the full advantage of agile best
                            practices.<br>
                            C. Gantt charts and project management information system<br>
                            Incorrect. It is unlikely that any of the team members would benefit from Gantt charts and
                            project management information systems since these tools are typically used in traditional
                            projects and, while not exclusively, are mainly intended for project managers rather than
                            team members.<br>
                            D. Whiteboards, index cards, sticky notes, web cameras, microphones<br>
                            Correct. Although this set of tools is not complete, it is the best option among the choices
                            given. This collection contains items that would help both the co-located and the remote
                            team members to perform their day-to-day work and collaborate as encouraged by agile best
                            practices.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            Although some of the project team members may be released before the project has been
                            closed, some of the project team must remain to perform the activities associated with the
                            administrative closure of the project. Even if only the project manager remains on the
                            project, the project manager is considered a member of the project team. Note, the PMBOK®
                            Guide does not specify the order in which activities are performed during the Close Project
                            or Phase process. However, it makes sense that the project team cannot be released until all
                            other activities associated with the administrative closure of the project have been
                            completed. For example, the responsibility for sending the survey to the stakeholders and
                            analyzing the results can be delegated to a team member. Hence, of the available choices,
                            releasing the project team is the last action that should be taken and is, therefore, the
                            best answer to the question asked.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Conducting a survey to measure stakeholder satisfaction<br>
                            Incorrect. This answer choice does represent an action associated with the administrative
                            closure of the project. However, a member of the project team must be available to collect
                            and analyze the survey information. Therefore, measuring stakeholder satisfaction must be
                            completed before the project team can be released.<br>
                            B. Finalizing open claims<br>
                            Incorrect. Finalizing open claims is one of the steps completed during the administrative
                            closure of the project. Claims may result as part of the procurement process. The question
                            states that the project was completed exclusively with internal resources, which means that
                            vendors were not used for the project. Therefore, it is not logical that any claims would
                            exist in this scenario. Even if the project did have an open claim, this is not the last
                            activity, of the available options, to be performed.<br>
                            C. Transferring the final product to operations<br>
                            Incorrect. Transferring the final product to operations is one of the tasks that should be
                            completed for administrative closure of the project. However, one or more team members will
                            be required to perform this activity. Therefore, the project team cannot be released until
                            this activity is complete.<br>
                            D. Releasing the project team<br>
                            Correct. Although some of the project team members may be released before the project has
                            been closed, some of the project team must remain to perform the activities associated with
                            the administrative closure of the project.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            The scenario implies that the project manager is working on the communications management
                            plan which describes the way communications will be planned, structured, implemented, and
                            monitored for effectiveness. The question is essentially asking to select the answer choice
                            which represents some of the information that should be included in the communications
                            management plan. Constraints such as organizational policies regarding the use of social
                            media, regulations related to confidential information, or the availability and reliability
                            of certain types of technology will affect how project communications are managed and,
                            therefore, would be included in the communications management plan.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Strategies and actions needed to involve stakeholders in decision making<br>
                            Incorrect. Strategies and actions needed to involve stakeholders in decision making are
                            described in the stakeholder engagement plan. In the scenario, the project manager is
                            working on the communications management plan which outlines how communications will be
                            handled, not how stakeholders will be engaged.<br>
                            B. A list of potential risk responses<br>
                            Incorrect. The scenario suggests that the project manager is developing the communications
                            management plan, which describes how communications will be handled during the project. A
                            list of potential risk responses is included in the risk register, not the communications
                            management plan.<br>
                            C. Constraints derived from specific regulations, technology, or organizational policies<br>
                            Correct. In the scenario, the project manager is working on the communications management
                            plan. Constraints such as organizational policies regarding the use of social media,
                            regulations related to confidential information, or the availability and reliability of
                            certain types of technology will affect the way communication is planned and implemented.
                            These constraints will be included in the communications management plan.<br>
                            D. Project team roles and responsibilities<br>
                            Incorrect. Project team roles and responsibilities are typically included in the resource
                            management plan. In this scenario, the project manager is working on the communications
                            management plan not the resource management plan.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            The question implies that the Collect Requirements process is being carried out with the
                            defining and documenting stakeholders' needs. User stories, which are short, textual
                            descriptions of required functionality, are often developed during a requirements workshop.
                            User stories describe the stakeholder role, who benefits from the feature (role), what the
                            stakeholder needs to accomplish (goal), and the benefit to the stakeholder (motivation). The
                            incorrect answer choices represent activities that can only be performed after the
                            requirements have been determined. Therefore, of the available options, scheduling a
                            requirements workshop is the best response.<br>
                            Note, although the scenario suggests the project is managed using agile methodology where
                            traditional project management processes may or may not be conducted as specified in the
                            PMBOK® Guide, some of the answer choices and the explanations refer to the traditional
                            approach. Regardless of this, scheduling a requirements workshop is still the best answer to
                            the question asked.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Schedule a requirements workshop<br>
                            Correct. User stories, which are short, textual descriptions of required functionality, are

                            B. Hold an iteration retrospective<br>
                            Incorrect. An iteration retrospective is a scheduled review to record lessons learned from
                            the iteration. The question suggests that the Collect Requirements process is being
                            conducted and a retrospective would not be conducted as part of the Collect Requirements
                            process.<br>
                            C. Conduct a sprint review meeting<br>
                            Incorrect. A sprint review is a meeting where the project team demonstrates the product
                            increment that has been built during the iteration in order to get feedback from
                            stakeholders and gain the approval of the product owner. The question implies that the
                            Collect Requirements process is underway. Requirements must be determined before an
                            increment of the product can be developed. Note, the exam may use the terms "sprint" and
                            "iteration" interchangeably.<br>
                            D. Develop a requirements traceability matrix<br>
                            Incorrect. The requirements traceability matrix is a grid that links product requirements
                            from their origin to the deliverables that satisfy them. The question suggests that the
                            Collect Requirements process is underway, and the requirements traceability matrix is an
                            output of this process. Customer requirements must first be gathered before the information
                            can be recorded in the requirements traceability matrix.<br>

                          <div class="specificfeedback">Your answer is incorrect.<br>
                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            The scenario and answer choices describe changes to various project artifacts. The
                            configuration management plan should identify all of the project artifacts that have been
                            placed under configuration control, which means that an approved change request is required
                            to make any modification. Since no information was provided about what is contained in the
                            configuration management plan, assumptions need to be made as to which artifacts are
                            typically considered configuration elements. Unless some information has been provided to
                            the contrary, it is reasonable to assume that the project management plan, including all of
                            its components and associated baselines, are considered configuration elements. On the other
                            hand, the project documents are not typically placed under configuration control. In this
                            case, all of the correct answer choices represent elements of the project management plan,
                            and the incorrect choices are project documents.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. A suggestion has been made to change from predictive to a hybrid development
                            approach.<br>
                            Correct. The development approach is the method used to create and evolve the product,
                            service, or result during the project life cycle. Examples of the development approach are
                            predictive, iterative, incremental, agile, or hybrid. The development approach is an element
                            of the project management plan and, as such, is typically placed under configuration
                            control.<br>
                            B. The project is running well over budget, and the cost baseline needs to be revised to
                            reflect reality.<br>
                            Correct. The cost baseline, along with the other project baselines, is always considered a
                            configuration element. The project baselines are the most fundamental of the project
                            artifacts to be controlled. If the baselines are not controlled, then essentially, the
                            project would be lacking any formal change control process.<br>
                            C. The project sponsor wants to add a document to the configuration management plan.<br>
                            Correct. The configuration management plan is the component of the project management plan
                            that describes how to identify and account for project artifacts under configuration control
                            and how to record and report changes to them. Since the configuration management plan is a
                            subsidiary of the project management plan, it is typically a configuration element.<br>
                            D. The revised status of several tasks needs to be reflected in the project schedule.<br>
                            Incorrect. The project schedule is an output of a schedule model that presents linked
                            activities with planned dates, durations, milestones, and resources. The project schedule is
                            typically maintained with specialized software tools and will be revised on a daily basis as
                            work on the project progresses. It would not make sense to perform change control on the
                            project schedule as it is in a state of constant flux. It is the schedule baseline, not the
                            project schedule, that should be placed under configuration control.<br>
                            E. A senior executive has recommended updating the project life cycle description to include
                            an additional phase.<br>
                            Correct. The project life cycle describes the series of phases that a project passes through
                            from its initiation to its closure. The project life cycle description is an element of the
                            project management plan and is typically placed under configuration control.<br>
                            F. A new stakeholder has just been identified and needs to be added to the stakeholder
                            register.<br>
                            Incorrect. The stakeholder register is a project document that includes the identification,
                            assessment, and classification of project stakeholders. The stakeholder register will likely
                            evolve throughout the course of the project as new project stakeholders are identified,
                            stakeholders become disassociated from the project, and more is learned about individual
                            stakeholders. Unless stated otherwise in the scenario, updates to the stakeholder register
                            do not require an approved change request.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            The scenario implies that the project manager is involved in the Monitor Communications
                            process. This process is concerned with ensuring that the information needs of the project
                            and its stakeholders are met. It can be reasonably assumed that the project is managed with
                            traditional methods, as evident by the use of the communications management plan and the
                            submission of a change request. However, when an agile practice, such as information
                            radiators, is incorporated into a project, the project becomes hybrid. An information
                            radiator is a physical or digital display that provides an up-to-date status of the project.
                            The display if often located in a visible place accessible to stakeholders, allowing them to
                            get an immediate status about the project. When digital information radiators are used, the
                            project status can sometimes be updated even instantaneously, making it an ideal tool for
                            those stakeholders who feels the current cadence of reporting the project status is not
                            frequent enough or insufficient. Therefore, incorporating the use of information radiators
                            is what the project manager should include in the change request.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Incorporating the use of information radiators<br>
                            Correct. An information radiator is a physical or digital display that provides an
                            up-to-date status of the project. The use of information radiators would best address the
                            stakeholder's concern and is, therefore, what the project manager should include in the
                            change request.<br>
                            B. Eliminating the distribution of email reports<br>
                            Incorrect. Eliminating the distribution of the email reports that are currently sent to the
                            stakeholders would diminish even further the value of information shared with the
                            stakeholders and, therefore, is not the best option to include in the change request.<br>
                            C. Reporting project status at the daily standups<br>
                            Incorrect. It's a common misconception that daily standup meetings are aimed to provide
                            project status. Project managers that are used to traditional methods tend to turn daily
                            standups into status meetings, thus negating the benefit of what a daily standup is all
                            about: a short, typically 15-min, meeting to report on work done yesterday (including any
                            impediments to progress) and work planned for today.<br>
                            D. Sending project status to fewer stakeholders<br>
                            Incorrect. The problem described in the scenario is not the number of stakeholders with whom
                            the project status is shared, but rather the frequency and the means by which the
                            information is communicated. Therefore, sending project staus to fewer stakeholders is
                            unlikely to resolve the issues encountered by the stakeholders.<br>

                            The question involves two processes: Acquire Resources (independent contractors are hired
                            for the project team) and Conduct Procurements (external resources, which could be both
                            physical and human, are procured). Advertising, that was used by the project manager to
                            attract potential contractors, is a tool or technique of the Conduct Procurement process.
                            Decision making is one of the tools and techniques that may be used as part of the Acquire
                            Resources process.<br>
                            The context of the question (procuring resources for the project team) suggests that of the
                            two processes, Acquire Resources and Conduct Procurements, the former is likely the process
                            one should focus on. Decision-making techniques that can be used in the Acquire Resources
                            process include multicriteria decision analysis. With multicriteria decision analysis,
                            criteria are developed and used to rate or score potential resources (applicants for
                            contract work in this case). The criteria are weighted according to their relative
                            importance and values, and can then be applied to the candidate pool to determine the best
                            applicants to serve on the project team. Of the choices provided, using the multicriteria
                            decision analysis tool will be most helpful for the project manager in selecting the project
                            team members from a large list of qualified applicants and is, therefore, what the project
                            manager should do next.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Apply the source selection criteria to the candidate pool<br>
                            Incorrect. Source selection criteria is a set of attributes desired by the buyer which a
                            seller is required to meet or exceed to be selected for a contract. However, the question
                            states that the candidate list has already been narrowed down to those that are qualified to
                            perform the project work. Therefore, the source selection criteria have already been applied
                            to the candidate pool, making this answer choice a redundant step.<br>
                            B. Submit a change request to update the resource management plan<br>
                            Incorrect. The resource management plan may be updated to reflect actual experience in
                            acquiring resources for the project. However, based on the scenario, the project team
                            members have not yet been selected from the candidate pool. Therefore, submitting a change
                            request to update the resource management plan is premature.<br>
                            C. Update the lessons learned repository<br>
                            Incorrect. The lessons learned repository is a store of historical information about lessons
                            learned in past projects. When the project is in progress, it is the lessons learned
                            register, not the repository, that should be updated to document the experience of using
                            social media to acquire contractors. Therefore, updating the lessons learned repository is
                            not what the project manager should do next.<br>
                            D. Use multicriteria decision analysis to select the independent contractors<br>
                            Correct. With multicriteria decision analysis, criteria are developed and used to rate or
                            score potential resources. The criteria are weighted according to their relative importance
                            and values. The use of multicriteria decision analysis will be most helpful for the project
                            manager to select the independent contractors from a large list of qualified applicants and
                            is, therefore, what the project manager should do next.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            In the mainstream agile approach, there really is no such thing as scope creep, since Agile
                            Manifesto principle #2 actually encourages changing requirements. The principle states,
                            "Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for
                            the customer's competitive advantage." Agile project management is based on short-terms
                            stability but long-term flexibility. Short-term stability refers to the fact that once the
                            agile project team starts working on developing the product increment planned for the
                            sprint, no changes can be requested by the customer, product owner, or other project
                            stakeholders. This is referred to as reciprocal commitment. Long-term flexibility refers to
                            the fact that while the project team is performing the work during a sprint, the product
                            owner allows the customer to change requirements in subsequent sprints, based on those user
                            stories that, at that particular point in the project, represent either the highest value or
                            the highest risk.<br>
                            Note, exceptions may apply in various situations, for example, when the requested feature is
                            critical for the customer, or required by regulations, or the risk associated with the
                            feature is high so that postponing the development of the feature may result in even higher
                            risk to the project, to name but a few. According to the scenario, however, there is no
                            urgency associated with the feature. Therefore, including the feature in the current sprint
                            two days before its end makes little sense.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Work with the customer to prioritize the feature in the product backlog<br>
                            Correct. Agile best practices suggest that the product owner should let the team finish the
                            work that has been assigned to the team members for the current sprint and then, with the
                            customer, prioritize the feature that has been forgotten by the customer in the product
                            backlog.<br>
                            B. Request that the customer submit a change request<br>
                            Incorrect. A change request is typically required on traditionally managed projects or
                            projects that incorporate hybrid methods with a change control system in place. Since the
                            scenario only indicates that an agile project is underway, it is reasonable to assume that
                            new features or modifications to the existing ones do not require a change request.<br>
                            C. Instruct the team to develop the feature in the current sprint<br>
                            Incorrect. The team members should continue their focus on completing the work assigned to
                            them in the current sprint. Developing a new feature without evaluating its value, risk, and
                            other criteria two days before the sprint's planned end date seems like an uninformed
                            "knee-jerk" reaction.<br>
                            D. Reject the feature as instructed by the senior manager<br>
                            Incorrect. While adding the feature in the current sprint may be indeed too late,
                            considering the feature for one of the upcoming sprints is aligned with agile best
                            practices. Rejecting the feature requested by the customer just because the senior manager
                            thinks it represents scope creep is an unwarranted response.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            The question implies that the Monitor and Control Project Work is being carried out. Monitor
                            and Control Project Work is the process of tracking, reviewing, and reporting the overall
                            progress to meet the performance objectives defined in the project management plan. All of
                            the incorrect answer choices are activities which are associated with the Monitor and
                            Control Project Work process. Individuals or groups affected by the project is a partial
                            definition of stakeholders. "Stakeholder analysis" is disguised by the correct answer
                            choice. Stakeholder analysis is performed during the Identify Stakeholders process in order
                            to develop the stakeholder register. Note, the question is asking to select the activity
                            that is 'least' likely to be conducted during the Monitor and Control Project Work process.
                            Performing stakeholder analysis is the 'least' likely activity to be conducted by the
                            project manager in this scenario and is, therefore, the best answer to the question
                            asked.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Analyzing individuals or groups affected by the project<br>
                            Correct. The question implies that the Monitor and Control Project Work is being carried
                            out. Individuals or groups affected by the project is a partial definition of stakeholders.
                            Stakeholder analysis is performed during the Identify Stakeholders process in order to
                            develop the stakeholder register. Therefore, performing stakeholder analysis is the 'least'
                            likely activity to be conducted in this scenario.<br>
                            B. Checking the status of individual project risks<br>
                            Incorrect. As part of the Monitor and Control Project Work process, the project manager may
                            check the status of individual project risks.<br>
                            C. Providing forecasts to update the current cost and schedule information<br>
                            Incorrect. Providing forecasts to update the current cost and schedule information is a
                            function of the Monitor and Control Project Work process.<br>
                            D. Monitoring implementation of approved changes as they occur<br>
                            Incorrect. Although approved changes are implemented through the Direct and Manage Project
                            Work process, 'monitoring' of the implementation of approved changes is an aspect of the
                            Monitor and Control Project Work process.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            The language of the scenario implies the project has both predictive and adaptive
                            attributes. For example, project execution is carried out using adaptive practices
                            (iterations) while the encompassing project management approach is predictive (as evident
                            from the terms, such as project initiation, planning, execution, the approval of the project
                            management plan, etc.). In this hybrid environment, project processes should be tailored to
                            the needs of the project and its stakeholders. The Initiating Process Group consists of two
                            processes, Develop Project Charter and Identify Stakeholders. The project charter documents
                            project constraints, among other elements, and stakeholders are continuously engaged and
                            provide their ongoing feedback. In adaptive/hybrid projects, competing priorities and
                            changing dynamics may cause the project constraints and success criteria to become obsolete,
                            as described in the scenario. Therefore, to ensure the project is moving within constraints
                            and toward goals that reflect the latest information, the processes of the Initiating
                            Process Group should be performed regularly. For example, the project charter can be
                            revised, and stakeholder needs and expectations addressed on each iterative cycle. In the
                            scenario, the project team has completed five iterations. If the processes of the Initiating
                            Process Group were performed at the beginning of each iteration, it is possible that the
                            situation described in the scenario could have been avoided.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Colocating the project sponsor with the team and the project manager<br>
                            Incorrect. Colocation involves placing project team members in the same physical location to
                            enhance their ability to perform as a team. Colocating the project sponsor with the team and
                            the project manager makes little sense and is unlikely to prevent the situation described in
                            the scenario.<br>
                            B. Regularly performing the processes of the Initiating Process Group<br>
                            Correct. On adaptive projects (as the one described in the scenario), shifting priorities
                            and changing dynamics may cause the project constraints and goals to become obsolete. To
                            ensure the project is moving within constraints and toward goals that reflect the latest
                            information, the processes of the Initiating Process Group should be performed regularly,
                            making this choice the best answer to the question asked.<br>
                            C. Terminating the project before obtaining the authorization to start it<br>
                            Incorrect. Terminating the project before obtaining the authorization to start it would have
                            definitely prevented the situation from occurring since no project means no issues. While
                            such an explanation may sound sarcastic, this answer choice was intentionally designed to be
                            implausible.<br>
                            D. Nothing could have prevented the situation described in the scenario<br>
                            Incorrect. Although the project sponsor, manager, team, and other stakeholders may have
                            little to no control over shifting priorities and changing dynamics described in the
                            scenario, there are various actions that could have been taken to prevent, or at least
                            diminish, the negative impact these priorities and dynamics have had on the project.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            Fast tracking is a schedule compression technique that can be used during the Develop
                            Schedule process. In this technique, activities on the critical path that were planned to be
                            performed sequentially are performed in parallel for some or all of their duration, thus
                            shortening the overall project length. While no additional resources are required while
                            applying fast tracking, the project manager should be aware that fast tracking may result in
                            rework and an increased risk.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Crash the project<br>
                            Incorrect. Crashing the project requires additional resources. The project sponsor refused
                            to provide funds to bring in more people.<br>
                            B. Fast track the project<br>
                            Correct. Fast tracking is a schedule compression technique in which critical path project
                            activities that were planned to be executed sequentially are performed in parallel resulting
                            in a shorter project duration.<br>
                            C. Apply resource leveling<br>
                            Incorrect. Resource leveling usually increases the project duration.<br>
                            D. Do nothing<br>
                            Incorrect. Doing nothing knowing that the project will not be completed on time is not a
                            responsible choice of project manager.<br>

                          <div class="specificfeedback">Your answer is incorrect.<br>
                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            The scenario describes the Plan Stakeholder Engagement process. Lessons learned repository
                            is an organizational process asset which can be used as an input to this process. When
                            planning stakeholder engagement for the project, the project manager should take in the
                            lessons learned from other projects that had to engage with similar stakeholders. In the
                            scenario, the project stakeholders of the senior management team are known not to respond or
                            attend meetings. Other projects have learned ways to gather feedback or other forms of
                            engagement. Learning from their successes and failures will reduce the chances of the
                            current project repeating failures and increase successes. Planning approaches without
                            consulting past or current attempts and methods risks the project wasting time, money,
                            resources, and more.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Patiently wait until management indicates that they are available to provide their
                            input<br>
                            Incorrect. Passively waiting for stakeholders to determine their own engagement with the
                            project is not a wise solution unless that approach is explicitly stated as a successful
                            tactic from the lessons learned of other projects and conversations with the
                            stakeholders.<br>
                            B. Schedule regular, short update meetings at a constant time and convenient location<br>
                            Incorrect. Senior management has a history of not attending meetings. Scheduling more of
                            them and hoping for a different result is an unwise strategy. The type, timing, and
                            structure must be understood first.<br>
                            C. Review lessons learned from other projects involving the management stakeholders<br>
                            Correct. Lessons learned from other projects can be an extremely valuable input to the Plan
                            Stakeholder Engagement process. Learning from the successes and failures of other projects
                            can guide the plans for the current project.<br>
                            D. Require one senior management representative to attend meetings or the project will be
                            halted<br>
                            Incorrect. Forcing rules that a project manager may not be able to enforce is doomed to
                            fail. A project manager's primary goal is to deliver project objectives within time and
                            budget. Halting a project as a result of unattended meetings risks the goal being met.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            Develop Team is the process of improving competencies, team member interaction, and the
                            overall team environment to enhance project performance. In the scenario, after you invest
                            in team training, you notice a high performer and task her with advanced responsibilities to
                            improve project performance, implying you are involved in the Develop Team process. When
                            team development results in changes to assignments, the changes are recorded in the project
                            team assignments documentation. Updates to project team assignments is among the outputs of
                            the Develop Team process. While there are many other places to record individual
                            capabilities, this question is focused on changes to assignments, making project team
                            assignments the best answer to the question asked.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Resource calendar<br>
                            Incorrect. Resource calendars identify the working days, shifts, weekends, hours and
                            holidays when resources are available. However, this document does not necessarily include
                            the full capabilities, roles, and responsibilities of each team member.<br>
                            B. Project team assignments<br>
                            Correct. Project team assignments record the team members and their roles and
                            responsibilities for the project. When team development results in new duties, the project
                            team assignments documentation should be updated.<br>
                            C. Risk register<br>
                            Incorrect. The risk register is the project document that captures the result of the risk
                            management activities. While this document specifies risk owners and may list the name of
                            the team member as one of the risk owners, the risk register does not provide information on
                            duties assigned to the project team members.<br>
                            D. Quality inspection report<br>
                            Incorrect. 'Quality inspection report' is a made-up term. Quality reports are an output from
                            the Manage Quality process; they provide information on quality management issues detected
                            by the team. Inspections are among the tools and techniques of the Control Quality process;
                            they are used to examine project deliverables to determine if they conform to the documented
                            standards. While both documents may specify the name of the individual that conducted the
                            inspection or prepared the report, none of these documents specify the duties of the team
                            members.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            The question best describes the compromise/reconcile conflict resolution technique. There
                            was some give and take on both sides to resolve the conflict, with some tests performed
                            before assembly and some tests performed post-assembly. Both parties gave up something and
                            received partial satisfaction relative to their initial position. The compromise/reconcile
                            approach is the best description of the scenario presented by the question.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Smooth/accommodate<br>
                            Incorrect. The smooth/accommodate approach emphasizes areas of agreement rather than areas
                            of difference, conceding one's position to the needs of the others to maintain harmony and
                            relationships. However, the question indicates that both parties only partially conceded
                            their positions.<br>
                            B. Force/direct<br>
                            Incorrect. The force/direct approach involves pushing one's viewpoint at the expense of
                            others, offering only a win-lose situation. Whereas, the question suggests that each of the
                            parties gained a partial victory. Therefore, this is not the best answer choice.<br>
                            C. Compromise/reconcile<br>
                            Correct. The compromise/reconcile approach is exemplified by searching for solutions that
                            bring some degree of satisfaction to all parties in order to temporarily or partially
                            resolve the conflict. Of the available choices, the compromise/reconcile approach is best
                            described by the question.<br>
                            D. Withdraw/avoid<br>
                            Incorrect. The withdraw/avoid approach involves retreating from an actual or potential
                            conflict situation, but the premise of the question indicates that the project manager did
                            intervene to resolve the conflict. Therefore, this answer choice can be eliminated.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            The question implies that the Plan Resource Management process is being carried out, and a
                            responsibility assignment matrix (RAM) is one of the tools associated with this process. A
                            RACI chart is a common type of RAM that uses responsible, accountable, consult, and inform
                            statuses to define the involvement of stakeholders in project activities. In the scenario
                            described, activities such as acquiring the 3D printer, training to operate and maintain the
                            printer, etc., are shown in the left column, while the roles and responsibilities of the
                            team members assigned to these activities are shown in rows. Therefore, a RACI chart is the
                            best tool for documenting the responsibilities for future reference.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Requirements traceability matrix<br>
                            Incorrect. The requirements traceability matrix is a grid that links product requirements
                            from their origin to the deliverables that satisfy them. The requirements traceability
                            matrix does not have responsibility assignments for project activities.<br>
                            B. Project team directory<br>
                            Incorrect. The project team directory is a documented list of project team members, their
                            project roles, and communication information. However, the project team directory does not
                            have activity level assignments.<br>
                            C. RACI chart<br>
                            Correct. A RACI chart is a common type of responsibility assignment matrix that uses
                            responsible, accountable, consult, and inform statuses to define the involvement of
                            stakeholders in project activities.<br>
                            D. Probability and impact matrix<br>
                            Incorrect. The probability and impact matrix is a grid for mapping the probability of
                            occurrence of each risk and its impact on project objectives if that risk occurs. The
                            question is asking about activity level responsibilities rather than project risks.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            When planning risk responses, trigger conditions, symptoms, and warning signs of a risk
                            occurrence may be included in the risk register. A trigger condition is an event or
                            situation that indicates that a risk is about to occur. In this scenario, the construction
                            manager noticed that there was too much levity and was concerned that the demolition team
                            was not being serious enough about safety. The construction manager recognized that the
                            hazardous attitude being displayed by the demolition team represented a trigger condition,
                            which prompted the risk response of calling in the safety manager to discuss safety
                            protocols with the team. Therefore, of the choices provided, the use of a trigger condition
                            is the best answer to the question asked.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. The implementation of a secondary risk response<br>
                            Incorrect. A secondary risk is a risk that arises as a direct result of implementing a risk
                            response. In this case, there is only one risk that is being described.<br>
                            B. The use of a trigger condition<br>
                            Correct. The jocular nature of the crew is a trigger that indicates they are not serious
                            enough about safety and that the detonation should be delayed until after receiving a few
                            reminders about safety.<br>
                            C. The employment of a delayed response strategy<br>
                            Incorrect. A 'delayed response strategy' is not a risk strategy specified in the PMBOK®
                            Guide.<br>
                            D. The utilization of an avoidance strategy<br>
                            Incorrect. Risk avoidance is a risk response strategy whereby the project team acts to
                            eliminate a threat. However, in this situation, the detonation is only being delayed to
                            discuss safety. Since the detonation will still take place, it cannot be determined at this
                            point if the risk will be eventually avoided. Therefore, the scenario describes a risk that
                            is being delayed rather than avoided.<br>

                            recurring cost of using, maintaining, and supporting the product resulting from the project.
                            In the scenario described, the number of design reviews was limited allowing for a lower
                            budget and a shorter timeline. However, the subsequent support costs are higher than
                            anticipated and could be a result of the reduction in the number of design reviews.
                            Therefore, if you had considered the impact of fewer project design reviews before deciding
                            to reduce them, perhaps the higher support costs could have been avoided.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Nothing. Limiting the number of design reviews will always increase the product's
                            operating costs.<br>
                            Incorrect. Generally, the earlier errors are identified in the project; the less expensive
                            they are to correct. However, limiting the number of design reviews will not 'always'
                            increase a product's operating costs. When choosing answers, try to avoid options that
                            contain absolutes, such as always, all, never, and none.<br>
                            B. Consider the impact of fewer project design reviews before deciding to reduce them<br>
                            Correct. As the project manager, you are primarily concerned with the costs required to
                            complete project activities. However, Project Cost Management should also consider the
                            effect of project decisions, such as limiting the number of design reviews, on the
                            subsequent recurring cost of using, maintaining, and supporting the product. Generally,
                            problems detected earlier in a project are less expensive to correct. The decision and
                            impact of limiting the number of design reviews should have been given greater attention and
                            consideration by the team.<br>
                            C. Planned a better transition to operations<br>
                            Incorrect. The scenario described does not include any information on the transition
                            process, only that the support costs are higher than anticipated. The higher support costs
                            alone is not enough information to determine the transition to operations was problematic;
                            therefore, this is not the best answer to the question asked.<br>
                            D. Nothing, you are only responsible for the outcome of your project.<br>
                            Incorrect. As the project manager, your primary concern is the cost of resources to complete
                            project activities. However, project decisions, such as limiting the number of design
                            reviews, can affect the costs realized after transitioning the product to operations or
                            support. The effect on future recurring costs should be considered when making project
                            decisions. Therefore, this is not the best answer.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            The question implies that the Estimate Activity Resources process is being carried out.
                            Bottom-up estimating is one of the tools and techniques that may be used during this
                            process. Bottom-up estimating is a technique in which team and physical resources are
                            estimated at the activity level and then aggregated to develop the estimates for work
                            packages, control accounts, and summary project levels. Of the available options, bottom-up
                            estimating is the best tool or technique to use in the situation described by the
                            question.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Resource leveling<br>
                            Incorrect. Resource leveling is a resource optimization technique in which adjustments are
                            made to the project schedule to optimize the allocation of resources. The question indicates
                            you are planning the resources, not the schedule.<br>
                            B. Resource histogram<br>
                            Incorrect. A resource histogram is a bar chart showing the amount of time that a resource is
                            scheduled to work over a series of time periods. According to the scenario, you are carrying
                            out the Estimate Activity Resources process, not one of the scheduling processes.<br>
                            C. Analogous estimating<br>
                            Incorrect. Analogous estimating uses information regarding resources from a previous similar
                            project as the basis for estimating a future project. The question states that this is the
                            company's first software development project, and therefore, will not have a past project to
                            use as the basis for making estimates for the current project.<br>
                            D. Bottom-up estimating<br>
                            Correct. Bottom-up estimating is a technique in which team and physical resources are
                            estimated at the activity level and then aggregated to develop the estimates for work
                            packages, control accounts, and summary project levels.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            With the new technology used on the project, many changes anticipated from the customer,
                            keeping the cost baseline under control, and the need to deliver incremental value
                            frequently, selecting the right project management approach is essential. Such a project
                            environment is best addressed using the combination of agile and predictive methodologies.
                            As far as project scheduling is concerned, applying iterative schedule with a backlog to
                            develop the product is a common agile practice. The requirements are documented in user
                            stories that are then prioritized and refined just prior to their development, and the
                            product features are built using time-boxed periods of work, typically called iterations.
                            This approach is often used to frequently deliver incremental value to the customer, which
                            is what was required by the project sponsor in the question. Adaptive methodologies are
                            better suited to projects with frequently changing project requirements, such as in the
                            scenario described. When using an adaptive life cycle, the time-boxed periods for releases,
                            waves, and iterations are specified. Time-boxed periods are durations during which the team
                            works steadily toward the completion of a goal. Therefore, of the choices provided, using
                            time-boxing to address frequent changes and delivering value to the customer would help the
                            most, making time-boxing the best answer to the question asked.<br>
                            Note, agile projects typically have a fixed budget. Therefore, when functional product
                            increments are delivered frequently, the risk the project budget will be exceeded is low.
                            The reason being is that when the project runs out of budget, the project can be terminated
                            at any given moment, but the customer will still have the latest functioning product
                            increment delivered in the most recent iteration. This is the most likely reason the sponsor
                            indicated that the cost baseline should be kept under strict control.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Time-boxing<br>
                            Correct. Time-boxing is an effective tool that can be used on projects where requirements
                            are anticipated to change frequently. This approach is used on agile projects where the
                            requirements are documented in user stories that are prioritized and refined just before
                            being developed, and the product features are delivered using time-boxed periods of
                            work.<br>
                            B. Integrated change control<br>
                            Incorrect. Integrated change control addresses scope creep. Still, it is typically a lengthy
                            process that does not always accommodate rapidly changing project requirements, especially
                            when frequently delivering incremental value to the customer is of the utmost priority, as
                            stated by the scenario.<br>
                            C. Risk register<br>
                            Incorrect. The risk register is a project document where outputs of the risk management
                            processes are documented. The risk register has little to do with the frequently changing
                            requirements.<br>
                            D. Quality control measurements<br>
                            Incorrect. Quality control measurements are the documented results of control quality
                            activities. While testing the changes to meet the project quality standards is necessary,
                            carrying out these activities does not address the essence of the question, which is
                            addressing frequent changes and delivering incremental value to the customer.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            In agile projects, work to be completed is represented by the user stories. User stories
                            comprise the product/release/iteration backlog. The way the backlog is prioritized depends
                            on various factors. Customer value is typically the most important one. However, along with
                            customer value, risk should also be considered. The scenario does not provide sufficient
                            details as to whether or not the backlog was prioritized properly. However, based on the way
                            the scenario is framed, one can imply that the high-risk user stories were prioritized low
                            in the backlog because they were of low value to the customer. When planning risk-related
                            work, it is better to address high-risk items sooner rather than later, so that if the risk
                            is realized, there will be sufficient time to address the event and to help minimize the
                            impact on the iteration or release. Therefore, of the choices provided, scheduling the
                            completion of the high-risk user stories in the product backlog sooner rather than later in
                            the release cycle would have likely helped avoid the situation described in the
                            scenario.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Overtime should have been authorized, and resources added in the weeks leading up to the
                            release to mitigate the impact of the high-risk user stories.<br>
                            Incorrect. Adding resources and authorizing overtime may (or may not) help in speeding up
                            the development. This course of action, however, is unlikely to resolve risk-related issues
                            that occur later in the project. This approach is also counter to agile best practices.<br>
                            B. The product owner should have been more diligent in writing the user stories in the
                            release backlog so that the risk is minimized or removed completely.<br>
                            Incorrect. The risk exists more due to the nature of the work than how that work is
                            described in a user story. It would be hard to impossible to eliminate risk based solely on
                            how the work needed to be completed is described in the user story.<br>
                            C. There is really nothing that could have been done to avoid the issue described because
                            risk events always occur just before the scheduled release date.<br>
                            Incorrect. It is always possible to influence the probability and impact of identified risk
                            events. An agile best practice is to address the high-risk user stories earlier in the
                            project. Discovering problems sooner rather than later allows more time to address and
                            resolve these problems.<br>
                            D. The product owner could have scheduled the completion of high-risk user stories in the
                            product backlog sooner rather than later in the release cycle.<br>
                            Correct. While the product owner prioritizes the product backlog primarily based on customer
                            value, project risk should also be considered when grooming the product backlog. It is
                            better to schedule the completion of high-risk user stories early in the project so that if
                            the risk occurs, there is time to resolve the issue before it threatens the schedule.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            According to the Tuckman ladder model of team development, a newly formed project team will
                            start in the forming stage. During this stage, the team members are still learning their
                            role within the team and how to collaborate with one another. In this scenario, the project
                            team is in the forming stage and may not be capable of self-management at the onset of the
                            project. The agile coach may need to adopt a more directive leadership style for the first
                            sprint or two and then transition to a more supportive leadership approach once the team
                            begins to coalesce.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Ignore the problem as agile teams are supposed to be self-managing.<br>
                            Incorrect. Ideally, agile teams are self-managing. However, a newly formed team may not be
                            capable of effective self-management in the beginning. Additionally, ignoring any problem
                            with the project or project team is not likely to be the correct answer. At a minimum, the
                            agile coach should monitor the situation to determine what action to take, if any.<br>
                            B. Assign the user stories to individual team members from now onward.<br>
                            Incorrect. The agile coach may need to assign tasks to individual team members while the
                            team is in the forming stage. However, as the team develops and collaboration improves, the
                            coach should transition from directive to a supportive leadership style. Thus, assigning the
                            user stories to individual team members from now onward is an overreaction.<br>
                            C. Replace the team charter with one from a more productive project team.<br>
                            Incorrect. The project team may or may not benefit from updating the team charter in this
                            situation. However, the team charter will be most effective when it is developed by the
                            project team members, or when they are at least given the opportunity to contribute to it.
                            Working agreements from a different team may not be particularly relevant to this team.<br>
                            D. Take a more directive approach since the team is still in its forming stage.<br>
                            Correct. A newly formed project team may not be capable of self-management at the outset.
                            The agile coach may need to adopt a more directive leadership style while the team is in the
                            forming stage, which is the stage implied by the scenario.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            The scenario implies the business is concerned with the processes of the Project Procurement
                            Management Knowledge Area. The challenge in the scenario described is that some of the
                            requirements that the business is planning to outsource to a vendor are stable while others
                            are not. When some deliverables have well-known requirements while others will have to be
                            discovered and elaborated as the project progresses, applying a hybrid project management
                            approach for the contracting work is likely to be the best course of action. This means that
                            the business may use a predictive approach for some deliverables and an adaptive approach
                            for other parts. In these cases, a governing agreement, such as a master services agreement
                            (MSA) may be used for the overall engagement, with the adaptive work being placed in an
                            appendix or supplement. This allows changes to occur on the adaptive scope without impacting
                            the overall contract. Therefore, using the master services agreement (MSA) is the best
                            answer to the question asked.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Vendor and contractor conference<br>
                            Incorrect. Prior to proposal submittal, the buyer and prospective sellers (vendors) can use
                            meetings to ensure that all vendors have a clear and common understanding of the
                            procurement, and no vendors receive preferential treatment. Some of the names of these
                            meetings are bidder conferences, vendor conferences, contractor conferences. These
                            conferences are not used to contract with a vendor, as asked by the question, but rather to
                            clarify the procurement requirements. This answer choice is intentionally misleading,
                            combining similar terms (vendor and contractor) in the same concept, such as bidder
                            conferences.<br>
                            B. Request for proposal (RFP)<br>
                            Incorrect. Request for proposal (RFP) is an example of a bid document that can be used as
                            part of the Plan Procurement Management process. An RFP is used in cases when there is a
                            problem in the project, and the solution is not easy to determine. The RFP is not used to
                            contract with a seller, but to solicit sellers' responses with a proposed solution.<br>
                            C. Master services agreement (MSA)<br>
                            Correct. A master services agreement (MSA) is a contract between the buyer and seller that
                            can be used with a hybrid project management approach when the overall engagement for the
                            contracted work is documented in the main part of the MSA, while the adaptive portion of the
                            work is placed in an appendix or supplement.<br>
                            D. Procurement management plan<br>
                            Incorrect. The procurement management plan is a component of the project management plan
                            that contains activities to be undertaken during the procurement process. The procurement
                            management plan in itself is not used to contract with a vendor but rather serves as a
                            guideline, or prescription, on the process of contracting.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            Agile Manifesto Value #4 states that responding to change is valued more than following a
                            plan. Although all of the answer choices are possible responses to the changes introduced to
                            the project described in the scenario, only one actually follows agile best practices.
                            Working with all project stakeholders to reprioritize the remaining features on the project
                            and preparing a new product roadmap and product backlog to meet the original project
                            completion date is the best response in this situation. Collaboration increases the chances
                            of getting the needed buy-in from the stakeholders. This approach helps to ensure that the
                            reduced and reprioritized project backlog is accepted by all those who are involved in the
                            project. Implementing this response to the organizational change will give the new company
                            owners and other relevant stakeholders confidence that the team will meet the re-defined
                            project objectives.<br>

                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Work with all project stakeholders to reprioritize the remaining features preparing a new
                            product roadmap and backlog to meet the original project completion date<br>
                            Correct. Given the project has lost resources, it is unlikely that all of the features or
                            user stories will be able to be completed within the established timeline with reduced
                            resources. Reprioritizing the remaining features in the product backlog is an agile best
                            practice whenever scope, resources, or deadline changes.<br>
                            B. Continue working with the current product roadmap and backlog and have the remaining team
                            members work overtime to meet the original project completion date<br>
                            Incorrect. Agile best practices aim to establish development processes that are sustainable.
                            Overtime and extra hours are indications that the development process is
                            unhealthy/unsustainable. This is a poor example of adapting to change.<br>
                            C. Evaluate the skill sets of the remaining team members and redistribute the team members
                            where they will be most effective at bridging the gaps caused by the staff reduction<br>
                            Incorrect. Evaluating the project resources is a helpful practice, but does nothing to
                            address the challenge of a static project deadline, unchanged scope (the number of user
                            stories to develop remains the same), and reduced staff.<br>
                            D. Continue working with the current product roadmap and backlog, and create a risk register
                            to track instances where planned work is not completed due to reduced resources<br>
                            Incorrect. Continuing to work toward the delivery of a product using unrealistic timelines
                            tends to increase defects and technical debt, and degrades product quality over time.
                            Tracking instances of incomplete work in the risk register sounds like a reactive approach.
                            This course of action also looks like an attempt to find an excuse that can be provided to
                            management when the question of why not all work has been completed arises at the end of the
                            project.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            Project managers must lead and manage the project team. Dealing with people, like those on
                            the project team, and getting things done requires a project manager to apply various
                            leadership styles within a project and sometimes across projects. There is no one 'correct'
                            way to lead a project. Circumstances in this scenario suggest that the project manager's
                            style to best be associated with servant leadership. Servant leadership puts the team first
                            and seeks to enhance the connections and collaboration of the team. The project manager can
                            serve as an encourager. Pushing the team forward by clearing the way, removing distractions,
                            and supporting the team would help the team and the project to achieve the project
                            objectives. Applying this style of leadership then enhances the connections and community
                            aspects of the team.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Communications leadership<br>
                            Incorrect. 'Communications leadership' is a made-up term.<br>
                            B. Servant leadership<br>
                            Correct. Servant leadership is a leadership approach where the project manager serves and
                            supports the needs of the project team over everything else to maintain the high-performance
                            level of the team and achieve the project objectives.<br>
                            C. Transformational leadership<br>
                            Incorrect. Transformational leadership is a style that seeks to empower and inspire others
                            to follow or develop oneself via idealized attributes and behaviors. Inspirational
                            motivation is used as part of this leadership approach. According to the scenario, the team
                            is already working as a well-organized high-performing unit and does not need any further
                            motivation to complete the project work or deepen the relationships amongst the team
                            members.<br>
                            D. Charismatic leadership<br>
                            Incorrect. Charismatic leadership is based on the personality of the leader and is aimed to
                            inspire the team and strengthen the relationships among the team members. The project
                            manager's charisma is not required to deepen the relationships of the team that has known
                            each other for a length of time.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            The question implies that you, as a servant leader, are leading an agile team within an
                            overarching predictive environment, which includes the use of a resource management plan.
                            Individual and team assessments are among the tools and techniques associated with the
                            Develop Team process, the implementation of which should be documented in the resource
                            management plan. The information gleaned from conducting individual and team assessments can
                            then be used to create the team performance assessments.<br>
                            Individual and team assessments can be incorporated into the existing iteration
                            retrospectives as the project team should be discussing their processes and how they
                            interact as a team in order to identify areas for improvement. Thus, the individual and team
                            assessments are aligned with the primary purpose of the iteration retrospective. For
                            example, team member attitudes toward the project and other team members can be assessed,
                            and gaps in training and development might be identified. The servant-leader should
                            facilitate the iteration retrospective and ensure that any developmental needs are
                            identified so they can be addressed as part of continuous improvement efforts.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Incorporate the use of attitudinal surveys into the daily standup meetings and apply the
                            outcomes derived from them to create the monthly team performance assessments<br>
                            Incorrect. A daily standup meeting is a time-boxed and narrowly focused meeting for the
                            development team to coordinate their daily activities. This would be an inappropriate time
                            to conduct surveys and assessments. Additionally, collecting this information on a daily
                            basis would not be a good use of time and resources as the results are unlikely to change
                            significantly from one day to the next.<br>
                            B. Conduct project retrospective to gain insights into how the team can improve their
                            processes, and use the knowledge gained to create the team performance assessments<br>
                            Incorrect. Conducting a project retrospective is a good idea. However, the project
                            retrospective is conducted at the end of the project and would not be particularly useful
                            for continuous improvement efforts throughout the project. Additionally, the question
                            indicates that a team performance assessment must be produced monthly rather than just at
                            the end of the project.<br>
                            C. Incorporate individual and team assessments into the existing iteration retrospective
                            meetings and use the information obtained to create the monthly team assessments<br>
                            Correct. An iteration retrospective is conducted at the end of each iteration (typically two
                            weeks) and provides the team with an opportunity to review their processes to uncover
                            opportunities for improvement. The iteration retrospective serves as an ideal opportunity to
                            conduct individual and team assessments to support the continuous improvement efforts of the
                            team.<br>
                            D. Submit a change request to remove the requirement for the monthly team assessments as
                            agile teams are self-organizing and work in the absence of centralized control<br>
                            Incorrect. Agile teams are considered self-organizing, and they do typically work in the
                            absence of centralized control. However, even agile teams need servant leadership, and one
                            of the responsibilities of the servant leader is to ensure that the team has all of the
                            resources they need to be successful, including training and development. Additionally, the
                            requirement for producing monthly team performance assessments was included in the resource
                            management plan for a reason, and there is nothing presented in the scenario to suggest it
                            would not be of value.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            The scenario is ultimately providing the description of the definition of done (DoD).
                            According to the references provided, the Definition of Done (DoD) is a team's checklist of
                            all the criteria required to be met so that a deliverable can be considered ready for
                            customer use. The DoD for a product increment to be developed by the agile team is created
                            by the team members at the beginning of each sprint. If the team fails to meet these
                            criteria, their work would not count towards the velocity of the current sprint and would
                            most likely be rejected. According to The Scrum Guide™, "When a Product Backlog item or an
                            Increment is described as 'Done', everyone must understand what 'Done' means. Although this
                            varies significantly per Scrum Team, members must have a shared understanding of what it
                            means for work to be complete, to ensure transparency. This is the definition of 'Done' for
                            the Scrum Team and is used to assess when work is complete on the product Increment."<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Estimate to complete<br>
                            Incorrect. Estimate to complete is the expected cost to finish all the remaining project
                            work. The scenario refers to the criteria specified at the beginning of the sprint that
                            determines if the work will or will not be included in the velocity for the current sprint.
                            These criteria do not include the expected cost to finish all the remaining project
                            work.<br>
                            B. Definition of done<br>
                            Correct. The definition of done is a shared understanding of what it means for work to be
                            complete. It is the checklist established by the team members at the beginning of the
                            project or sprint that specifies the criteria required to be met so that a deliverable
                            developed during the project or sprint can be considered ready for the customer use.<br>
                            C. Project exit criteria<br>
                            Incorrect. The project exit criteria are the conditions, which, if met, would result in the
                            project or phase successful closure or early termination. Those criteria are specified in
                            the project charter and apply to the project as a whole rather than to a specific sprint,
                            particular deliverable, or product increment.<br>
                            D. Quality metrics<br>
                            Incorrect. Quality metrics are a project document and one of the outputs from the Plan
                            Quality Management process. A quality metric describes a project or product attribute and
                            how the Control Quality process will verify compliance with it. Quality metrics are
                            typically not used in agile projects like the one described in the scenario.<br>

                          <div class="specificfeedback">Your answer is incorrect.<br>
                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            The question indicates that the project needs assessment has been completed. The project
                            needs assessment typically precedes the development of a business case, which, in turn,
                            serves as one of the inputs to the Develop Project Charter process. The Develop Project
                            Charter process belongs to the Initiating Process Group. During project initiation,
                            specifically, during the development of the project charter, the key project deliverables
                            are identified and documented in the project charter. Therefore, of the choices provided,
                            identifying key project deliverables is the most likely next step that should be taken in
                            the scenario described. The other answer choices represent activities, which take place
                            later in the project life cycle.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Selecting a new inventory tracking system<br>
                            Incorrect. The question scenario suggests that senior management is still doing project
                            pre-work. The project itself does not yet exist, and the project charter is not yet
                            developed. Selecting a new inventory tracking system as a next step may be premature.
                            Therefore, this choice is not the best answer.<br>
                            B. Acquiring project team members<br>
                            Incorrect. While some of the team members can be pre-assigned to the project as early as
                            during project initiation, typically, the team is acquired during project execution, which
                            has not yet started.<br>
                            C. Carrying out the project kick-off meeting<br>
                            Incorrect. The project kick-off meeting is usually associated with the end of planning and
                            the start of executing. According to the scenario, the project is still early in
                            initiation.<br>
                            D. Identifying key project deliverables<br>
                            Correct. The question indicates that task #1 of the initiating domain has just been
                            completed, which includes the project needs assessment. Task #2 is to identify key
                            deliverables based on the business requirements and is, therefore, the best answer to the
                            question asked.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            The Agile Manifesto's values include both "Customer collaboration over contract negotiation"
                            and "Individuals and interactions over processes and tools." Customer collaboration with the
                            delivery team is a fundamental aspect of all agile methods. It is one of the reasons that
                            agile projects have a high rate of success and an even higher rate of customer satisfaction.
                            Getting the customer involved as part of the process helps to ensure that what is being
                            developed is of very high value and meets the customer's expectations. The greater the
                            customer involvement, the greater the level of customer commitment to the success of the
                            project. Coding standards are important, and having a vendor whose personnel are agile
                            certified is a great benefit. However, without a regular flow of feedback from the customer,
                            neither coding standards nor agile certified vendors would have as great an impact as
                            regular contact and feedback between the customer and the vendor.<br>
                            Note that the company is the scenario is a buyer, and the vendor is a seller. The "customer"
                            in the correct answer choice refers to the company's customer. While it is reasonable to
                            assume that the company would be the one to interact with the vendor, the idea behind this
                            question is to allow the customer to interact not only with the company but also with the
                            company's vendors.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Ensuring that the vendor's employees and associates are agile certified<br>
                            Incorrect. Although it would be beneficial for the vendor staff to be agile certified
                            practitioners, it is not a requirement when working with external vendors, whether the
                            project is traditional, agile, or hybrid. Some government projects may have such a
                            requirement. However, the scenario does not specify this.<br>
                            B. Establishing contracts as fixed-cost with incentives<br>
                            Incorrect. Many contracting approaches may be used when working with external vendors on an
                            agile project. The most common types of contracts are fixed-price work packages and
                            graduated fixed-price contracts. It is not required that a fixed-cost with incentives
                            contract type be used.<br>
                            C. Maintaining regular contact and feedback with the company's customer<br>
                            Correct. All agile methods require regular stakeholder and customer feedback. The most
                            important thing to emphasize and establish with an external vendor on an agile project is
                            that the project is structured to ensure that customers can provide regular feedback to the
                            vendor during development.<br>
                            D. Enforcing coding standards, pair programming, and continuous integration<br>
                            Incorrect. Although this answer choice describes some of the best practices used by agile
                            teams, 'enforcing' these practices is unlikely to be the best course of action. A vendor is
                            free to select a practice that works for them as long as the contract is fulfilled.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            A life cycle of a typical traditionally managed project consists of initiation, planning,
                            execution, monitoring and controlling, and closure. Overall project risk is the effect of
                            uncertainty on the project as a whole. Many various factors contribute to the overall
                            project risk: technical, managerial, commercial, external, to name but a few. Deliverables
                            are not produced up until the project enters its execution. Project objectives, such as
                            scope, schedule, cost, quality, etc. are not being measured during project initiation and
                            planning. At that point, there are many unknowns, and it's even unclear if the project will
                            meet its objectives. Therefore, the overall project risk at the beginning of the project is
                            the greatest. As the project progresses, decisions are made, and deliverables and produced
                            and accepted the overall project risk decreases. During project closure, there are typically
                            not too many unknowns left (if at all). After the deliverables are accepted, and the
                            project's objectives are met, the "victory" can be declared. This is where the overall
                            project risk is considered very low or non-existent. Therefore, of the choices provided, the
                            risk is considered the greatest during project initiation (area A).<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. A<br>
                            Correct. Area A represents project initiation. On traditionally managed projects, project
                            initiation is characterized by the biggest number of unknowns from various categories:
                            technical, managerial, commercial, external, to name but a few. Therefore, overall project
                            risk is greatest at the start of the project.<br>
                            B. B<br>
                            Incorrect. Area B represents project planning. On traditionally managed projects, project
                            planning typically involves the development of the project management plan. No deliverables
                            are produced during project planning. However, more is known about the project, and some
                            decisions are made. Hence, the level of risk is not the greatest.<br>
                            C. C<br>
                            Incorrect. Area C represents activities associated with project execution as well as
                            monitoring and controlling. The focus of the project during this stage of its life cycle is
                            to produce the deliverables. As deliverables are completed and accepted, decisions are made,
                            and uncertainty is left behind, the level of project risk decreases.<br>
                            D. D<br>
                            Incorrect. Area D represents project closure. At this point in the project life cycle, all
                            deliverables are supposed to be completed and accepted, and project objectives met. By that
                            time, the project is supposed to have little to none unknowns, and, therefore, the overall
                            project risk should be at its lowest level.<br>

                          <div class="specificfeedback">Your answer is incorrect.<br>
                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            The question implies that you, as the project manager, have overemphasized leadership at the
                            expense of management. Although you were highly effective at inspiring and motivating the
                            project team to create a truly exceptional product, operational aspects of the project have
                            not been addressed causing the project delays. Project managers need to employ both
                            leadership and management in order to be successful. A project manager must strike the right
                            balance between management and leadership to be successful. Had you focused more on
                            management and the operational aspects of the project, you may have been able to avoid the
                            delays and kept the project on schedule.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Relied exclusively on management skills in handling the project<br>
                            Incorrect. A successful project manager must find the right balance between management and
                            leadership. Relying exclusively on one or the other is not likely to provide optimal
                            performance.<br>
                            B. Developed better leadership skills<br>
                            Incorrect. The question suggests you, and the project manager, have demonstrated effective
                            leadership skills by inspiring and motivating the project team. However, your management
                            skills are lacking as demonstrated by numerous unaddressed operational issues.<br>
                            C. Struck the right balance between management and leadership<br>
                            Correct. The question implies that you, as the project manager, have overemphasized
                            leadership at the expense of management. A project manager must strike the right balance
                            between management and leadership to be successful.<br>
                            D. Selected a more detail-oriented project team<br>
                            Incorrect. The question implies that the schedule issues are more likely the result of a
                            lack of management skills rather than how detail-oriented the team members are.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            The scenario describes the Collect Requirements process. Facilitating a meeting is an
                            example of the interpersonal and team skills that can be used as one of the tools and
                            techniques associated with this process. A story-writing workshop is a meeting that includes
                            developers, customer representatives, end-users, and other stakeholders who can contribute
                            to writing the user stories. During the workshop, the participants write as many user
                            stories as they can. No priorities are associated with the user stories at this point
                            because the customer will have a chance to do that later. While the initial user stories are
                            often written during a user story workshop, stories can be written at any time throughout
                            the project.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Kick-off meeting<br>
                            Incorrect. Kick-off is a meeting that typically takes place early in a project life cycle
                            and focuses on communicating the objectives of the project, gain commitment of the team to
                            the project, and explain the roles and responsibilities of the stakeholders. Nothing in the
                            scenario matches this description.<br>
                            B. User story workshop<br>
                            Correct. A user story workshop is a meeting that includes developers, customer
                            representatives, end-users, and other relevant stakeholders who all collaborate to write
                            user stories. This definition accurately represents the meeting described in the scenario,
                            making this choice the best answer to the question asked.<br>
                            C. Sprint planning meeting<br>
                            Incorrect. Sprint planning is a meeting at which the participants plan the work for the
                            upcoming sprint. While it is possible that some clarifications about the work items can be
                            discussed at the sprint planning meeting, the scenario describes a meeting at which the
                            attendees create work items rather than plan to develop them during the upcoming sprint.<br>
                            D. Backlog grooming workshop<br>
                            Incorrect. Grooming the product backlog involves reviewing the backlog and ensuring that the
                            product owner has worked with the customer and relevant stakeholders to prioritize the order
                            of the work items properly in terms of customer value, risk, and other considerations.

                            Explanation: <br>
                            The scenario describes a client, The Ministry of Transportation, who, for some reason,
                            decided that due to high risk, the project should be managed using traditional methods.
                            Projects with high risks are better served by agile, rather than traditional methods.
                            However, when risk management processes are properly performed, any project management
                            approach would work as long as the stakeholders are aware of the pros and cons of each
                            approach. It is not required to know the real motive of the client behind the selection of
                            the project management approach to answering the question. It is important, however, to
                            notice that according to the scenario, the team will need to rely on the client's
                            representative who will be able to clarify requirements and provide ongoing feedback. This
                            approach is very typical of agile, where this role is often performed by a product owner who
                            continuously works with the development team to clarify and prioritize requirements and
                            provide inputs to ensure that the correct project outputs are being delivered. The product
                            owner is a project stakeholder. Stakeholders are identified as part of the Identify
                            Stakeholders process. Therefore, of the choices provided, Identify Stakeholders is the
                            process the project manager should use to identify the client's representative.<br>
                            Note, when a traditional project meets agile practices, such as in the scenario described,
                            the overall project management approach becomes hybrid.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Identify Representatives<br>
                            Incorrect. "Identify Representatives" is not a process specified in the PMBOK® Guide. This
                            is a made-up term we created for this question.<br>
                            B. Identify Risks<br>
                            Incorrect. Identify Risks is the process of identifying individual project risks for further
                            analysis or action. This process is not used to identify individuals or groups that can
                            clarify requirements and provide ongoing feedback for the product/service being
                            developed.<br>
                            C. Identify Stakeholders<br>
                            Correct. Identify Stakeholders is, in short, the process of identifying project
                            stakeholders. Of the choices provided, only Identify Stakeholders is the process that may
                            help the project manager with the identification of the individual who can represent the
                            client in clarifying requirements and providing ongoing feedback to the team on the project
                            deliverables.<br>
                            D. Collect Requirements<br>
                            Incorrect. Collect Requirements is the process of determining, documenting, and managing
                            stakeholder needs and requirements to meet project objectives. While this process may help
                            understand the level of knowledge of various stakeholders about the product being built, the
                            main goal of this process is to provide guidance on how the scope will be managed rather
                            than find a knowledgeable client's representative who will work with the team.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            The scenario indicates that the project is in the execution stage. Mentoring stakeholders
                            may occur as part of project execution. Of the available options, only Manage Communications
                            and Manage Stakeholder Engagement are included among the execution processes, and mentoring
                            is associated with both of these processes. Mentoring is one example of a communication
                            technique that might be used in support of the Manage Communications process. Additionally,
                            mentoring might be used as a technique to develop the project team members as part of the
                            Develop Team process. Team members are considered project stakeholders. The scenario does
                            not specify if any of the new stakeholders are part of the project team. However, this
                            information is not required to answer the question correctly. In general, since project team
                            members are considered project stakeholders, it is possible that one or more of the mentees
                            are part of the project team. The incorrect answer choices represent project management
                            processes that are not part of project execution and do not typically employ mentoring as a
                            technique.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Develop Project Charter<br>
                            Incorrect. The project charter is developed during project initiation. According to the
                            scenario, the project is in execution. Therefore, assuming all project management processes
                            have been properly implemented, the project charter should have already been created earlier
                            in the project life cycle.<br>
                            B. Plan Communications Management<br>
                            Incorrect. The communications management plan is created as part of the Plan Communications
                            Management process, which is part of project planning. The scenario, however, describes a
                            project in execution, making this choice an incorrect answer.<br>
                            C. Identify Stakeholders<br>
                            Incorrect. Stakeholders can be identified at any point during the project. However, in this
                            scenario, the mentoring sessions with the stakeholders have been scheduled, implying the
                            stakeholders are known and most likely have already been identified earlier in the project.
                            Additionally, mentoring is not typically done as part of the Identify Stakeholders
                            process.<br>
                            D. Manage Communications<br>
                            Correct. Feedback is among the communication techniques associated with the Manage
                            Communications process. Feedback supports interactive communication between the project
                            manager, team, and all other project stakeholders. Mentoring is one example of feedback that
                            might be used in support of the Manage Communications process.<br>
                            E. Develop Team<br>
                            Correct. Mentoring is a technique that might be used as part of training a new project team
                            member. Since project team members are stakeholders, it is possible that one or more of the
                            new stakeholders is a member of the project team, justifying an iteration of the Develop
                            Team process.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            Colocation is one of the tools and techniques of the Develop Team process. Colocation
                            involves placing many or all of the most active project team members in the same physical
                            location to enhance their ability to collaborate. Collaboration is intended to boost
                            productivity and facilitate innovative problem-solving. Collaborative teams may facilitate
                            accelerated integration of distinct work activities, improve communication, increase
                            knowledge sharing, and provide the flexibility of work assignments in addition to other
                            advantages. Collaboration among team members is one of the key elements of successful
                            projects. Among the choices given, physical colocation is the most effective way to create a
                            collaborative work environment. Caves and common enable face-to-face communication among the
                            team members as well as provide an individual quiet environment to complete tasks.
                            Colocation, if implemented properly, help build tacit knowledge, facilitates osmotic
                            communication, and allows team members more effectively apply agile best practices.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Physical colocation<br>
                            Correct. Physical colocation, when possible, is one of the most effective ways to create a
                            collaborative work environment. Physical colocation enables face-to-face interaction among
                            the team members, which contributes to a collaborative work environment. According to the
                            scenario, the company's management is ready to spend any resources. Therefore, physical
                            colocation is possible.<br>
                            B. Caves and common<br>
                            Incorrect. 'Caves and common' is an agile term describing the team's physical space
                            arrangement with a large area called 'common' where the team members work together most of
                            the time, and private spaces called 'caves' where individual team members can 'escape' for
                            short periods of time to work in a quiet environment. While the caves and common space
                            arrangement is helpful in creating a collaborative work environment, it is a specific case
                            of and is enabled by physical colocation and not the vice versa.<br>
                            C. Tacit knowledge<br>
                            Incorrect. Tacit knowledge is the undocumented information that is collectively known by a
                            group of people. Tacit knowledge is enabled by physical colocation and it is a result rather
                            than a cause of a collaborative work environment.<br>
                            D. Cultural diversity<br>
                            Incorrect. Cultural diversity is often an impediment to maximum collaboration between agile
                            team members but can normally be handled effectively. If a conscious effort is made to
                            compromise and understand the cultural differences of team members from different cultures,
                            it will help them embrace behaviors such as transparency and the ability for them to
                            collaborate openly, even if these behaviors are not natural to them.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            Creating a risk-adjusted backlog is a common agile approach used to address the potential
                            issues and threats to a project. In order to create a risk-adjusted backlog, the project
                            team must determine the business value of completing each user story as well as the business
                            value of addressing each project risk. Once a value has been associated with the delivery of
                            each user story and addressing each risk, the project team can compare them and determine
                            the priority for each activity. Depending on the value, it may be of greater business
                            benefit to address a particular risk than it would be to implement one of the user stories
                            that deliver product features. In this question, the team has determined the value of each
                            user story but needs to 'monetize' or determine the value of addressing each risk.
                            Calculating the Expected Monetary Value (EMV) for each risk identified allows the project
                            team to then prioritize one activity over another.<br>
                            For example, if a risk is estimated to have a 70% probability of occurring and its financial
                            impact on the project would be $10,000, its EMV can be calculated by multiplying the
                            probability by the impact or 0.70 x $10,000 = $7,000. If a user story is only expected to
                            provide $5,000 of business benefit, then it makes more sense to address the risk.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Internal rate of return (IRR)<br>
                            Incorrect. The internal rate of return is a measure of the discount rate at which a
                            project's revenues equal a project's costs. The calculation of IRR is normally associated
                            with project selection and is not used to determine the business value of addressing project
                            risks.<br>
                            B. Net present value (NPV)<br>
                            Incorrect. Net present value is a measure of how much money an investment, such as the money
                            invested in a project, can be expected to return in the future based on today’s present
                            value. NPV is not typically used to determine the business value of addressing project
                            risks.<br>
                            C. Expected monetary value (EMV)<br>
                            Correct. Calculation of expected monetary value is a common approach used to determine the
                            value of addressing an identified risk to the project. EMV uses the probability of the risk
                            occurring and the impact of that risk to determine the business value of addressing the
                            risk.<br>
                            D. Estimate at completion (EAC)<br>
                            Incorrect. Estimate at completion is an earned value metric used to estimate the actual cost
                            to complete a project. EAC is calculated using a formula that is determined by the
                            information provided using other earned value metrics. EAC can be determined and used for
                            agile projects but is not a means to assess the value of addressing project risks.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            The question presents the template for a cause-and-effect diagram. Cause-and-effect diagrams
                            are also known as fishbone diagrams, why-why diagrams, or Ishikawa diagrams. This type of
                            diagram breaks down the causes of the problem statement identified into discrete branches,
                            helping to identify the main or root cause of the problem. The first step in completing the
                            cause-and-effect template is to define the problem statement, or effect, which is placed in
                            the large box at the head of the fishbone. The next step is to label the branches with the
                            main categories for potential sources of defects (materials, equipment, procedures, people,
                            etc.). Finally, brainstorming is performed to determine the possible causes and then attach
                            them to the appropriate branches. Therefore, of the choices provided, defining the problem
                            statement or effect is the first thing for the team to do and is, therefore, the best answer
                            to the question asked.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Define the problem statement or effect<br>
                            Correct. Cause-and-effect diagrams are also known as fishbone diagrams, why-why diagrams, or
                            Ishikawa diagrams. This type of diagram breaks down the causes of the problem statement
                            identified into discrete branches, helping to identify the main or root cause of the
                            problem. Defining the problem statement or effect is the first step to take when this type
                            of the diagram is used to get to the root cause of the problem.<br>
                            B. Organize potential causes into groups<br>
                            Incorrect. Affinity diagrams can organize potential causes of defects into groups showing
                            areas that should be focused on the most. The diagram presented in the question is a
                            cause-and-effect diagram and not an affinity diagram.<br>
                            C. Record the series of steps that lead to the defect<br>
                            Incorrect. Flowcharts show a series of steps that lead to a defect. The diagram in the
                            question is a cause-and-effect diagram rather than a flowchart, making this an incorrect
                            response.<br>
                            D. Organize the potential causes of defects in rows and columns<br>
                            Incorrect. The matrix diagram seeks to show the strength of relationships among factors,
                            causes, and objectives that exist between the rows and columns that form the matrix.
                            However, the question presents a template for a cause-and-effect diagram and not a
                            matrix.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            The scenario implies the project is managed using a hybrid project management approach as
                            evident from the fact the budget is developed by aggregating cost estimates of work
                            packages, while the product is developed using agile methods. Agile development is typically
                            performed by self-organizing self-managing teams of generalizing specialists. However, being
                            self-organizing and self-managing does not necessarily mean the team members will be able to
                            self-educate themselves on the missing knowledge. Even if they can, the time they will spend
                            acquiring new knowledge and skills will likely be less productive, and the team members will
                            have to be paid while they are learning. Therefore, the time spend by the team studying the
                            new material should be accounted for in the project budget.<br>
                            Note, the scenario does not indicate that the team is missing any knowledge. However, none
                            of the answer choices suggests otherwise and, therefore, selecting the correct answer should
                            be done with the assumption in mind that some knowledge is missing.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Explain that even if the team members may learn the missing skills on their own, the
                            budget will still have to cover the time the team will spend to close the knowledge gap
                            since the team will be less productive during that period<br>
                            Correct. Regardless of whether or not the team members will be able to acquire the missing
                            knowledge, the time spent for the learning as well as training costs in case the training is
                            delivered by a consultant (whether internal or external) should be accounted for in the
                            project budget, making this choice the best answer to the question asked.<br>
                            B. Agree with the sponsor that self-organizing agile teams have the ability to self-educate
                            themselves on the missing knowledge and remove the amount accounted for the training of the
                            team members from the project budget<br>
                            Incorrect. Being self-organizing and self-managing typically refers to the team's ability to
                            make decisions related to their work. However, this does not necessarily mean the team
                            members will be able to self-educate themselves on the missing knowledge. If training is
                            needed, the time will have to be spent and paid by the organization.<br>
                            C. Request that the sponsor submit a change request to remove the costs of training for the
                            team members and, after the change control board approves the request, update the cost
                            baseline and project budget accordingly<br>
                            Incorrect. First, this action implies the project manager agrees with the sponsor that
                            training costs should be excluded from the budget. This assumption is wrong. Second, the
                            scenario suggests the project is in planning, inferring the baselines have not yet been
                            finalized. No change request is needed to update any of the not yet finalized baselines.<br>
                            D. Facilitate a meeting between the sponsor and the team and suggest that the sponsor uses
                            the fist of five voting technique to determine the level of support of the team to
                            self-educate themselves on the missing knowledge<br>
                            Incorrect. Part of this answer choice is a plausible course of action, i.e., consulting with
                            the team on their support in self-learning. However, it's the project manager, not the
                            sponsor who should lead the meeting; and even if the team agrees to close the knowledge gap
                            on their own, the time they will spend doing so should be accounted for in the budget.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            In the scenario, the project manager and the team demonstrate participatory decision making.
                            Participatory decision making is a creative process that delegates decision ownership to the
                            entire team. There are a variety of methods that are employed to help facilitate the finding
                            of a choice that is acceptable to the team. In an agile environment, the purpose of
                            participatory decision making is to supply the project team with specific practices to make
                            and analyze the countless decisions that arise during the project. The team members need to
                            be encouraged and enabled to collaborate and readily make decisions due to the short
                            timeboxes that are inherent in agile projects. This practice would also allow the team to
                            minimize or even prevent costly decision-making delays.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Cross-functional training<br>
                            Incorrect. A cross-functional team consists of individuals who are willing to explore other
                            areas of expertise with which they currently may not be familiar in order to increase the
                            overall efficiency and productivity of the team as a whole. An example of cross-functional
                            training would be to have a developer cross-trained on how to run an integrated testing
                            program. Although their primary expertise is in the area of development, they are willing to
                            expand their knowledge of testing to improve the team's capabilities.<br>
                            B. Self-organization<br>
                            Incorrect. Self-organization of an agile project team occurs when the majority of the tasks
                            performed by the team members have been selected, organized, and executed by them, rather
                            than being dictated by someone else. Members of self-organizing teams are much more
                            motivated when they understand that their input is welcomed and valued. Although
                            participatory decision-making benefits from a team's ability to self-organize,
                            self-organization is not the best answer to this question.<br>
                            C. Participatory decision making<br>
                            Correct. In participatory decision making, the team members participate in the decision
                            process, and the decision is made by a preponderance of the vote. While the process of
                            participatory decision making can be contentious, it is based on mutual trust and
                            respect.<br>
                            D. Collaboration<br>
                            Incorrect. Collaboration means ensuring that each agile project team member is involved at
                            every stage of the development process and that their feedback is not only welcomed but also
                            encouraged. It is a basic agile principle that permeates through all activities on an agile
                            project and is critical to agile project success. Although participatory decision making
                            depends on collaboration, another answer choice better addresses the question asked.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            Based on the scenario, it can be implied that the Develop Project Charter process has just
                            been completed. The project charter formally authorizes the project and documents the
                            high-level goals and business value, as well as other key information. Communicating the
                            final, approved information captured in the charter to all affected stakeholders ensures a
                            common understanding of the objectives, expected deliverables, milestones, and the
                            stakeholder's expected involvement. Of the choices provided, informing stakeholders of the
                            approved project charter is one of the first things the assigned project manager should do
                            and is, therefore, the best answer to the question asked.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Start the development of the project management plan<br>
                            Incorrect. While the development of the project management plan starts soon after the
                            project charter gets approved, another answer choice represents an action that should be
                            taken before the development of the plan begins.<br>
                            B. Acquire the resources necessary to perform the project work<br>
                            Incorrect. Although some of the resources can be pre-assigned early in the project life
                            cycle, most of the resources are typically acquired during project execution. According to
                            the scenario, the project is in late initiation / early planning, therefore, acquiring the
                            resources at this point is unlikely to be one of the first things for the project manager to
                            do.<br>
                            C. Inform stakeholders of the approved project charter<br>
                            Correct. As a formal, approved project charter has been issued, project stakeholders must be
                            informed of the objectives and other key information about the project.<br>
                            D. Perform a project assessment based on available information<br>
                            Incorrect. In the selection and chartering of the project, the assessments and evaluations
                            were already conducted. Additional project assessments performed by the project manager is
                            unnecessary at this point in the project.<br>

                            Explanation: <br>
                            Agile Manifesto Value # 4 calls for responding to change as being valued more than following
                            a plan. All answer choices describe the Agile Manifesto values, but only one is actually
                            supported by the situation presented in the scenario. A simple and light change management
                            process allows the customer to initiate the reprioritization of user stories. In doing so,
                            it is reasonable to assume that the project changed its original plan. This flexibility was
                            successfully implemented despite the project having a fixed budget and schedule. By
                            responding to the needs of the customer with the implementation of a light change management
                            process, the product owner and team helped ensure that the final deliverables contain the
                            features most valued by the customer and that the project completed on schedule and within
                            budget. In other words, the value of responding to change over following the plan was most
                            significantly demonstrated in the scenario.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Responding to change over following a plan<br>
                            Correct. The scenario emphasized the change management process, flexibility, welcoming, and
                            accommodating changes while including the features that represented the highest value to the
                            client. While the scenario does not explicitly mention that the original plan was not
                            followed, of the choices provided, responding to change over following a plan best addresses
                            the question asked.<br>
                            B. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation<br>
                            Incorrect. Although changes were accommodated through customer collaboration with the
                            product owner and team, there was no mention of external or internal contracts, negotiation
                            of which has been abandoned in favor of customer collaboration.<br>
                            C. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools<br>
                            Incorrect. The scenario indeed describes the implementation of a light change management
                            process. However, no specific details are provided as to whether or not individuals and
                            interactions were valued over processes and tools. Therefore, while this choice represents a
                            plausible answer, it is not the best response to the question asked.<br>
                            D. Working software over comprehensive documentation<br>
                            Incorrect. While it is true that the customer received working software with the features of
                            the highest value, the question does not mention anything about documentation being
                            "sacrificed" for the sake of delivering the product.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            Manage Quality is the process of translating the quality management plan into executable
                            quality activities that incorporate the organization's quality policies into the project.
                            The question states, "A project manager is executing the quality management plan of a
                            project..." This implies that the Manage Quality process is underway. Six Sigma is a common
                            quality improvement methodology that may be useful during the Manage Quality process. From
                            the statistical point of view, the term Six Sigma is defined as having no more than 3.4
                            defects per million opportunities (DPMO) or a success rate of 99.9997%. Therefore, Six Sigma
                            is the best answer to the question asked.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Utilize the Three Sigma quality improvement technique<br>
                            Incorrect. Three Sigma has a defect rate of no more than 66,807 defects per million
                            opportunities (DPMO). The question states that the target defect rate is no more than 3.4
                            DPMO, making this choice an incorrect answer.<br>
                            B. Use Six Sigma as a quality improvement methodology<br>
                            Correct. From the statistical point of view, the term Six Sigma is defined as having less
                            than 3.4 defects per million opportunities (DPMO) or a success rate of 99.9997%. Therefore,
                            of the choices provided, using Six Sigma as a quality improvement methodology is the best
                            approach to accomplish the goal described in the scenario.<br>
                            C. Perform the Plan-do-check-act process<br>
                            Incorrect. The plan–do–check–act (PDCA) cycle is a four-step quality improvement method
                            which is repeated for continuous improvement. While the PDCA method can be used during the
                            process described by the scenario, this method does not specify a threshold for the allowed
                            number of defects and, therefore, cannot help the project manager in achieving the goal
                            stated in the question.<br>
                            D. Design for X (DfX) is the most appropriate tool<br>
                            Incorrect. Design for X (DfX) is a set of technical guidelines that may be applied during
                            the design of a product for the optimization of a specific aspect of the design. DfX does
                            not set a specific threshold for defects; therefore, this answer choice can be
                            eliminated.<br>

                            <br>
                            Explanation: <br>
                            Depending on the type of organizational structure, the authority of project managers over
                            project resources may vary from little or none to high or almost total. When project
                            managers have little or no direct authority over team members, which is typical in the
                            matrix organization described in the scenario, their ability to influence stakeholders on a
                            timely basis is critical to project success. Influencing skills include the ability to be
                            persuasive, clearly articulate points, and gather relevant information to address issues
                            while maintaining mutual trust. In this scenario, you have lost three key team members and
                            need to utilize the resources that are still available. Influencing the employee's manager
                            will have the most significant impact on your ability to acquire more of this employee's
                            time for your project.<br>
                            <br>
                            Details for Each Option:<br>
                            A. Decision making<br>
                            Incorrect. Decision making will be used in this scenario, but it is not the best way to
                            acquire more of the employee's time. Since the employee is only partially allocated to your
                            project, you will need to negotiate for additional time, most likely with the employee's
                            manager, by using your interpersonal skill of influence.<br>
                            B. Issue log<br>
                            Incorrect. The issue log is an internal document where issues that have arisen on the
                            project are recorded. The issue log could be used to document the problem described in the
                            scenario, but it would not assist with acquiring more of the employee's time on the
                            project.<br>
                            C. Training<br>
                            Incorrect. Training includes all activities that are used to enhance the competencies of the
                            project team members. In this scenario, there is nothing to indicate the employee lacks
                            adequate training; therefore, this choice is incorrect.<br>
                            D. Influencing<br>
                            Correct. In a matrix environment, project managers often have little or no direct authority
                            over team members. Their ability to influence stakeholders on a timely basis is critical to
                            project success. Influencing skills include the ability to be persuasive, clearly articulate
                            points, and gather relevant information to address issues all of which would go the furthest
                            in gaining more of the employee's time on your project. Typically, to acquire more of the
                            employee's time for the project, a project manager will have to work with the employee's
                            manager trying to influence them in favor of the project.<br>
